B000XEEQAI Working out great I ordered these for my husband who wears a size 17 and it is very hard to find boots for him that are dependable and comfortable for his line of work.  He says they are super comfortable!  I only gave the review four stars because I am not sure how long they are going to hold out.  I may increase it to five stars if these boots last longer than six months, which is the track record for every other type of boot I've ordered for him so far, no matter what the brand or the price.

B0070ZBUES Comfy boots and very light As I said boot is comfy, true to size and fits just right.  Also they're very light weight unlike most boots which is nice.  Also easy to get on and off.  Its stopped snowing day before they were delivered so havent been able to do the snow test which is only reson i didnt five five stars but I am hopeful.  Not too high, just high enough on leg i think.  I'd recommend them. A very reasonable price too :)

B00AZPPEQ0 Upscale Shoes with Comfort Issues Five stars for style.  Five stars for quality construction.  Four stars for fit.  Three stars for comfort.  When I first put these shoes on I felt like I was standing on a rolling pin!  They hurt my feet and I was planning on returning them.  (NOTE to Timberland: Not every foot requires arch supports.  Mine certainly don't.  I guess my feet must be on the flat side.)  After a month of wear the arch supports seem to have molded to my feet somewhat and the comfort factor has improved.  As for the sizing, they might be a half size too big, however, the heavier wool socks I wear in the winter fill in the space nicely.  In the winter snow and slush the shoes look like they get wet, but feet stay dry and warm.  On balance a four-and-half star, high-quality, high-style selection.
B00AZPPEQ0 Five Stars Very comfortable and durable.  Excellent pair of shoes
