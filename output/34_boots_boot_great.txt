B00009WM7J got them for my daughter for her 19th birthday My daughter is very little. She loved the boots because they look like the ones as she say &#34;daddy wears&#34;. So now I have a 19 year old wearing timberland boots with her diva swagg.
B0000AFSX4 Great a great boot for active outdoor kids. the waterproof nature is good and works stepping through large puddles (on purpose of course). Good traction and makes for sure-footing outside, on hikes and the like. I didn't think it would be the best winter boot but there have been no complaints on cold snowy days regarding warmth. Obviously more time consuming to tie up than other boots so sometimes little ones don't want to take that time. A big difference from off brands is that the exterior holds up great, is of high quality and doesn't appear to &#34;scratch off&#34;. Very happy and will buy the next larger size next year. A bit pricey though....
B0000AFSX4 They fit perfectly! We actually bought a pair of these to help with my son's &#34;toe-walking&#34; and they are perfect. We live in Colorado so they are perfect for hiking and cold weather as well.
B0000AFSYY Great Boot The boots were for our 5-year old grandson. They are well constructed and our grandson loves them. He said they are very comfortable and must have not required any &#34;break-in&#34; as he seldom takes them off. Being waterproof is wonderful. Will definitely be buying this boot again when he outgrows these.
B0007T4IGG Great work boots. I purchased these for my son who works in a wet environment.  He has been super pleased with the fit and the performance of the boot.  He said he would recommend the boot to others describing the boot as &#34;high quality.&#34;
B000AKVBCQ DOES NOT MEET ASTM  F2412-05, F2413-05, I/75 and C/75 despite search results description Search results say &#34;stand up to ASTM F2412-05, F2413-05, I/75 and C/75 impact&#34; not &#34;meets&#34; and means &#34;do not meet ...&#34;If you are looking for shoes that MEET ASTM F2413-05 don't be fooled by the search results. THESE DO NOT MEET THE STANDARD.  &#34;stand up to&#34; is lawyer speak for &#34;DOES NOT MEET&#34;.  Cheesy move for an otherwise good company.
B000AKVBCQ Comfortable and attractive Wore them for two days and the site supervisor thought they were &#34;sneakers&#34;.  Didn't want boots that would not be usable in the summer.
B000AKVBCQ Great Comfort Steel Toe Shoe I have purchased about 15 of these over the past 10 years and that's why I can remember 81016. I wear them at work everyday walking on a concrete floor and it is unbelieveable how this shoe out performs others for comfort. I wear a medium width &#34;D&#34; in non steel toe shoes but the wide size &#34;W&#34; gives a little more toe room in this shoe. When I purchase a new pair for work I use the old one's to work around the house like yardwork etc.
B000B2HQ5O Laces are ridiculously long The laces on these things are a complete joke.  They could probably work on a grown-up's shoes.  With a two year old, that can equal disaster.  Imagine your son yelling from the backseat, &#34;Daddy tie my shoe!&#34;  It gets old real quick. Also getting his foot in the shoe is not very easy.  My in-laws bought some cheapo boots that have velcro and he loves them; he won't put these on.
B000B2HQ5O Waterproof! My son wore these on a rainy day hiking and his feet stayed warm and dry. He calls them his &#34;stomping boots&#34;
B000BB15ZC attractive boots I bought these as a gift in &#34;noir&#34; and I was a little nervous about it since the color &#34;black&#34; was sold out. I dont know what the difference is, but these look black to me, exactly what I was hoping for. They are attractive boots and will make for a nice gift.
B000BB15ZC If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I've had a pair of these (in a different color) for about 4 years now. They are just starting to wear out, so it was time to buy a new pair of boots. I was dreading the experience because I have really sensitive feet and I have to try on a pair and walk around for at least 20 minutes to see if my feet will hurt or not. I have to do this for each pair of boots I try, so the whole event takes at least 3 hours. I was going to go to the shoe store and go through another 3 hour &#34;fit-fest&#34; until it occurred to me &#34;I wonder if Timberland still make these boots?&#34; I happened to be at the store where I bought them before and they still had them, but for some reason the one box they had in my size only had one boot in it! I tried it on anyway to verify that they felt the same and it did. When I got home, I checked Amazon and they had them for about $30 less than the store, but they were out of my size in the brown color, so I bought these for a bit more. They fit and feel great and I really like the black color. Expect to get about 4-5 years out of yours, which is good, considering everything is made in China anyway.
B000BB15ZC Better than expected They fit great, are lightweight, and waterproof. Exactly what I was looking for. I've been wearing them as my &#34;every day&#34; shoes since the weather is still wet and snowy. My feet have stayed dry the whole time. I would absolutely buy another pair.
B000BB15ZC Solid, comfortable, and stylish boots I got stuck in a blizzard already and these kept my feet dry in and out of puddles of snow, ice and other random liquids in NYC. They did not get the best traction on metal surfaces when icy. They are extremely comfortable. I purchased originally for hiking but have been using them for daily use. They look great with jeans since they are a normal color and not some &#34;Hey I'm wearing hiking boots&#34; olive, brown and orange combo.
B000BFIHVS Perfect Lightweight Boot! The boots were delivered quickly and packaged nicely.  Depending on the manufacturer, I will wear a 14W or 15W.  I chose the 15W since I plan to use these for winter snow and will be wearing heavier socks.  They fit nicely, were comfortable out of the box, so much so, I ended up wearing them the rest of the day!  The other reviewers are correct, the leather is soft enough where no &#34;break in&#34; is needed.  They are light compared to other boots I own and more pliable for easy walking.  I am totally happy with these boots and can't wait for the first rainy day to test their water tightness.
B000BFIHVS Fit Ran Smaller than Indicated by Reviews My true size is 12.5.  The Timberland boots I was replacing (with these) were size 12...and they fit very well.  In addition, the website comments indicated that these Timberland White Ledge boots ran &#34;large&#34; ; i.e. choose a 12 instead of a 13.  Unfortunately, that was NOT my experience.  The size 12's were very tight and I needed to return them.  Found alternative &#34;CAT&#34; (non-Tim) boots (size 12) at DSW and went with those.
B000BFIHVS Great Boots Surprised my son with these at college.  He texted and said they are &#34;awesome&#34; and is very pleased with them.  His school is in an area that gets a lot of snow through the winter.  These will keep his feet dry and give him some traction in snowy/wet conditions.
B000BFIHVS Timberland Hiking Boots The boot fits as expected having previously owned other Timberland products.  I'm not big on the vinyl tongue as the look reeks of cheapness. and should have been either nylon or leather.  Other then the tongue and the other vinyl square afterthought on the heal I give them &#34;3&#34; stars.&#8203;
B000BFIHVS Sole Came Off I got these as a Christmas gift. They felt like heaven putting them on. They are very comfortable. About three months in, the soles just came off and started flopping! I looked under the tag and sure enough, &#34;Made in China&#34;. I thought so. There is no way I could repair them, so I had to throw them away. It was sad, cause the uppers where in perfect condition and these boots felt very good on my feet.
B000BFIHVS Best bang for the buck! I find these Timberland men's &#34;White Ledge Boot&#34; to be of very good quality in construction. The fit is secure and comfortable.  Although unlike others, I feel there needs to be some  break-in time for your own personal  comfort level,  For myself, I did not have any problems with the sizing.  Local retailers, in my area, posted &#34;Sale Prices&#34; at least ten to twelve dollars higher and up...This is the first pair of Timberlands Brand I have purchased and probably will buy again in the future.  Very satisfied with purchase of this product.
B000BFIHVS Cant wear due to the pain from the right boot rubbing on my ankle. Like the price, like the looks, like the apparent &#34;ruggedness&#34; of the boot, unfortunately the right boot has been rubbing the back of my leg just above the ankle and now after three days &#34;trying&#34; them out, I had to take them back off this morning as they were just too uncomfortable. Shame as I liked the boots..
B000BFIHVS 2nd pair.  Fit fine.  Comfy out of the box. I did a lot of walking and working for nearly 3 years in my first pair, a slightly different model (&#34;Conway&#34;) with same tread, and finally wore the soles off.  They were just a little small, though, so I ordered a half size larger this time and should have room for heavy winter socks too.  I put the new ones on and walked a couple of miles with no trouble.  No complaints here.  Good boots.  Good price.  Thanks.
B000BFIHVS COULD NOT GO WRONG WITH THE SIZING Straight out of the box - fit like a glove, soft, supple, and great looking.  Five mile break in hike - no issues!I could not be more pleased with a mail order purchase.  I was skeptical with mail order, but local shopping revealed no suitable products.  I have had good experience with Timberland in the past and decided I would order the hikers - same size as my &#34;topsider&#34; boat shoes.Great decision, great choice.
B000BFIHVS Great boots Great boots, very comfortable durable and look great.  Haven't had to use them in the rain or wet yet but hopefully the &#34;waterproof&#34; is as expected
B000BFIHVS Nice Boots I've worn these a few times during the &#34;Polar Vortex&#34; of 2013.  Temperatures were down to 10 below zero with 30 below wind chill factors.  With a good pair of Smartwool socks, my feet were the warmest part of my body.  The boots were comfortable right out of the box.  Boots normally take me a few weeks of discomfort before they are broken in, so this was a welcome change. They also had excellent traction on slippery sidewalks and parking lots.  I haven't had them out hiking yet, but I have no reason to believe that they won't perform well there too.  If I had one complaint, it would be that they are a little smaller than I expected.  I ordered a size that has always been appropriate to be worn with a heavy pair of winter socks and these boots were a little snug.  Not enough to cause my toes to fall asleep or any real discomfort, but not the wiggle room that I would like/expect.  All in all I like them.  I'd order a half size up the next time.
B000BFIHVS I had these before The only problem with these boots are, I wear out the soles in about a year or less.I purchased these because the &#34;hi-tec falcons&#34; that I gad ripped apart in just 5 months.
B000BFIHVS Excellent shoe Great shoes for a hiker in Florida.  Little &#34;breakin&#34; time needed for comfort.  I treated with mink oil right out of the box, as an extra-precaution.  In addition to making a great product, these shoes are made in USA, as well as Timberland does some great charity work.  Great shoe from a responsible company.  They earned my support and purchase.
B000BFIHVS Great boots for the price. Great boots, completely satisfied with this purchase. They arrived on time and in great shape. Would certainly recommend these to anyone, I wore them to a business meeting and did not feel &#34;foot wear&#34; underdressed.
B000BFIHVS Nice Boots I bought these for hiking/photography work.  They look really nice and fit well.  Right out of the box they were super comfortable.  I took them out for a 3 mile &#34;test drive&#34; and had no issues.  I haven't tried them in the wet yet so I can't comment on how weather proof they are.  Definitely a comfortable boot at a good price.
B000BFIHVS Not for real hiking I bought a pair of these last spring. They fit very nicely, were extremely comfortable and I was happy, until half way through the summer when the sides of both boots where they connect to the soles started to split wide open. The &#34;leather&#34; is paper thin bonded garbage and will not hold up to any real usage. These are meant for walks down the street, not hikes in the hills. If you want a good hiking boot, look elsewhere.
B000BFIHVS Service is EVERYTHING! Krystal with a &#34;K&#34; made my purchasing experience a joy! The boots arrived earlier than expected and they fit my son perfectly.
B000BFIHVS Comfy Boots for a Minnesota Fall Fit perfectly for the size 10.5 feet I carry around with me!  No rough or rubbing  during short hikes; most comfortable with a pair of 'Smart Wool&#34; or comparable type of sock.
B000FX9A5S Didn't fit This boot was a disappointment all the way around.  Well, it is an attractive boot, I will have to say.  But it was much too small for hubby.  He usually can wear them and &#34;break&#34; them in but these are steel-toe and they don't &#34;break in&#34;.
B000FX9A5S A+ Contractor approved I had 3 pair of Carolina boots in a row and these by far top every pair. 4 stitches at seams, Incredigrip soles, and eylet laced top top (unlike most boots that use the loop around). These fit like a glove and are tanned great. My new &#34;go to brand&#34;.
B000FX9A5S Soft feel for a steel toe boot, nice for colder weather Got these to replace my Pitboss model Timberlands.  It's nice to have full eyelets to the top for a better overall lacing/fit, and it surprisingly doesn' tmake them much harder to put on than the Pitboss style, which has the &#34;hook&#34; style catches for the top two rows of laces. They're also noticeably warmer (since they're insulated), but they'll probably be way too hot for temps above 70F.
B000G1Z9XG Timberland Euro Boots......  :-) The Timberland Men's Euro Boots, I would recommend to everyone that wants a good pair of boots.  These boots are comfortable, slip free and true to size.  I will be ordering another pair soon.  &#34;10 STAR&#34; boots.
B000G21BSC Ok boots I guess I expected better for all the money these boots cost.  But they have kind of a &#34;plastic&#34; feel, probably because there is very little real leather in them.  I did expect them to be totally authentic leather, but they are some sort of pieces of leather sewn over foamy stuff.  They feel stiff right now, maybe they will be better after they are worn for a while.  I am hoping.
B000G23DQK Well-made and comfortable Good boots, solid but not too heavy. Note that the collar is padded but the tongue is not. Very easy-wearing, feel like I've got shoes on because the soles/insoles are doing a good job. I did feel like the laces it came with were too short (measured at something crazy like 42&#34;), so I ordered some 60&#34; replacements, which are a little long but not unwieldy; 54&#34; should work fine.
B000G23DQK Geat work boots These are great boots for the bad weather. They have great traction, and are water proof. If I had a &#34;con&#34; with the boots, it would have to be the inner sole. It's a bit thin. That can be fixed with a third party sole you can get on the cheap from a Wal-Mart or any store.
B000G23DQK Fantastic Timbs I love Timberlands.  These are my second pair and they are no doubt great &#34;all-purpose&#34; boots.  I got these originally to wear in the snow (N'oreaster Nemo).  They are, as advertised, 100% waterproof.  The Olive color looks great and I can wear these as regular boots as well.  My only issue is the shoelace is a bit small if you want to lace them all the way up, but, all things considering, it's a minor gripe.  Would highly recommend anyone in the market consider these boots.
B000G23DQK Poor -painful design There is a painful design flaw with this boot. There is excess material formed were the the tongue of the boot connects to the part of the boot that laces. It digs into the shin and is painful. I tried lacing them loosely, tightly, and adjusting the tongue to the side with no relief. I read someone elses review of the same problem before I purchased mine hoping their experience was a fluke but they were spot on. I have been wearing &#34;timms&#34; for years and this is my first bad experience.
B000G23DQK Timberland Men's 10061 6&#34; Premium Boot Timberland Men's 10061 6&#34; Premium Boot,Wheat,12 Wi like this one  it's very goodi think buy black o o
B000G23X74 Great looking summer shoe Love wearing these Timberland &#34;boat&#34; shoes, especially without socks. This is my third pair of Timberland shoes of this type. The tops last longer than the soles. I wear these Timberlands until the soles wear through.
B000G23X74 good fit, great feel good shoe, feels great, looks good.could maybe use a bit more &#34;tread&#34; to the sole, pretty slippery when wet but not a deal breaker
B000G2419S A great waterproof boot The boots are not quite the &#34;taupe&#34; color shown in some lights but in sunlight is true to the pic. The texture of the material is rather more suede than leather, but it looks good and feels nice. I've been wearing them to work for the last week and they are mostly comfortable, with one caveat. The leather around the ankel can fold in many ways and one of the boots has creased in such a way that the front of the boot presses against the front of my foot a bit when I walk. Not a major issue but I took off a star since it is a bit unpleasant. Overall the boots look good and fit well.
B000G24LJS Perfect! I tried on some Timberland shoes at a local store and found that the &#34;8&#34; was the best fit in that shoe, so I gambled thinking that an 8 would be what I needed in the 3-eye Classic model.  I was right, the models were different but the sizing the same.  Thanks, lets hope the Saloman Speedcross 3 I just bought turns out the same.  I ordered size 8 again having tried on several name brands of running shoe though one of them was not Saloman.  Cross your fingers!  Thanks, Brandon
B000G24LJS They are not dead even when I get to the diveway sealer Ok  I am in a rut.  This is my go to shoe  --I have a bizillion pairs of these shoes in grades ranging from &#34;Sunday go to Meeting&#34;  through driveway sealer grade.
B000G24LJS Continuing to be a good product I've been wearing  these shoes, for about 20 years as they are comfortable and rugged enough for NE winter weather while still being &#34;stylish&#34; enough for office wear.I have noticed that the recent (last two pairs) the sizing has gotten a little narrower, primarily in the toe box, than in previous years. Thus if you were to have a wider foot size up a width.
B000HGZRYQ Waterproof These babies ain't waterproof!I was hoping that it would live up to its name i.e. &#34;Rugged street chukka&#34;. Its been less than 10 days since I bought the shoes, and water seeps in over and above the toe area. I am going to return it and hoping that its a defective or damaged product...Its a such an inconvenience...
B000KVA7YI Not bad Only for winter season, too hot for the summer. Next time will try 6&#34; model, this one is uncomfortable of long laces.
B000KVA7YI Great Work Boot Originally had these books at the 6&#34; height, but found the 8&#34; gives better support around the ankles.  They are waterproof and durable for any environment, definitely a good boot and one that I will get again.
B000MQL2TK not a bad sock, but not the favorite My son loves &#34;Life is Good&#34;  I thought Id try these to see if they compared, but he stated the comfort was not the same.
B000QW02F0 fit like a timberland I tend to breeze through the break in period in a half day on timberland boots, that's not hardly a problem. The problem I have is that I paid full retail (180$) and after 5 months they now sit with the other failed &#34;Waterproof&#34; boots in my garage. Now I didn't buy more waterproof spray because the seems have busted apart, there is no spray for that! The tread is a bear to clean Carolina clay out of and they just cost like sin for 5 months use..... :/
B000QW02F0 Good Quality Shoe This is the third time I have bought this shoe. They last long, and keep feet nice and dry. My husband's feet are more on the narrow side, and the &#34;M&#34; size fits snugly on his feet. Lots of times &#34;M&#34; sizes are not offered in work boots, and the boots are what he describes as feeling &#34;sloppy&#34; on his feet (not tying up tight enough). These boots keep his feet dry in all kinds of weather. My husband works both indoors and outdoors all year around. One word to the wise, though...make sure that you give yourself ample time to break these boots in. They can be brutal. My husband had to change into a different pair of boots mid-day to alleviate the stiffness and pain on his feet while breaking them in the first few days. After they are broken in, he says that they are the most comfortable pair of work boots he has owned. That is why we keep re-buying them when they wear out. He is hard on his boots, and they typically last about 18 months before needing to be replaced again.
B000VQ9QKS Comfortable and casual I really like these boots.  I ordered them a half size larger than usual so that I could wear thick hiking socks with them.  There was no real &#34;breaking in&#34; period and I found them comfortable right away.  I'm very glad that I bought them and think they are a good value.
B000VQ9QKS Best Boots Ever ! I bought my first pair of Chocoruas on New Years Eve day five years ago and fell in love with them immediately.  I needed a pair of boots to wear to First Night in Boston, where it was very cold and very snowy.  While still in the mall where the Timberland store was located, I decided I should take them for a test &#34;walk&#34; to make sure they'd be comfortable to wear all night walking around.  I was just amazed to find that I didn't even notice that I was wearing &#34;new shoes&#34;.  I wear these boots every day December - March and they are still in perfect condition.  I loved them so much that since I bought mine, I have bought nine more pairs for members of my entire family.  They all agree - These are the best boots ever !
B000VQ9QKS awesome Broke in very quickly, fits true to size, very supportive. Wear them in a barn on concrete all day, and landscaping in the evenings. Been very happy with them, will buy again as long as they hold up over time. Only thing is I wouldn't call them water &#34;proof,&#34; maybe water &#34;resistant.&#34;
B000VW69IY Great Shoe I've worn this shoe for years and really like it.  The fit is consistent, so I feel confident in ordering it without first &#34;trying it on at the store.&#34;
B000VW69IY quality The sandals are just as pictured...great color, comfort, and style.  I had been searching quite awhile and am glad I waited to &#34;run&#34; across these. Perhaps priced a bit high, but I expect them to last and again they look great.
B000VW69IY Alls well ,,,,,, The fit, the comfort & the look The &#34;shoe&#34; fits well, it's comfortable on the foot and extremely comfortable when walking in them. The look of the sandle is outstanding too.
B000VX01V4 disappointment I used to love Timberland shoes. They were extremely comfortable and tough as nails. These are not the same as what they made 5 or more years ago. The lower price should have been a clue. The sizing is different (I even ordered a half size large) and the left shoe is too narrow even though my right foot is wider. They have no cushioning, look flimsy, and bear only superficial resemblence to my older pairs which I still wear. Perhaps if you have never owned the &#34;real&#34; TImberland shoes and have narrow feet and don't care about comfort or quality you will like these. I returned my pair and I hate returning things.
B000VX03GC Good boots Was looking for something insulated and waterproof for long Russian winter. Yet I hate heavy boots, especially since I mostly drive. That timberland model looks little solution. Great price (They are almost 3 (!) times more expensive in local Timberland shop EVEN INCLUDING Amazon 3-day international shipping!), good quality and short break-in period.They are &#34;fit as expected&#34; but run strictly true to size, so I would go half size up if any doubt (I'm 10,5 - 11 guy and these are strictly 11)
B000VX03GC not very good quality I have had two pairs of the 8&#34; Chocurua and they have been excellent boots for fit and comfort. They are light weight and last accordingly, aboout a year of heavy use. The trail version seemed pretty cheap. I put them on and they creased across the top of my foot immediately and the leather got dimples like the boot was six months old. The left boot measured an 1/8&#34; shorter across the top of the boot than the right.I sent them back and am sticking with the 8.&#34;
B000VX03GC The last pair of shoes that you'll ever need. The Timberland Men's 15130 Chocurua Trail GTX Boot is the last shoe that I think I will ever buy. I'm currently on my third pair. The average lifespan on these shoes was about 18- 22 months of every day rough wear. They keep your feet dry, warm, and hold a solid grip on any terrain. They are properly &#34;broken in&#34; after about only two days of wear and feel like the shoes God himself would've designed if He'd have chosen to done so.
B000VX03GC Great construction. Trusted name. Comfortable fit (although a bit large) Timberland is a name you can trust. I've always known that; however, I've never had any. I like the way the inner &#34;tongue&#34; creates an enclosed barrier against the cold and potential water. Plus, the gortex material will prevent water seepage, as well. The leather is handsome and appears extremely durable and not just &#34;for show&#34; like cheaper models. Speaking of which, I think boots of this quality for less than $100 is a good deal.I'm looking forward to breaking these in this weekend, as I'm headed to the mountains to hike, write and relax.
B000VX03GC My husband loved these We had found these in store, but was able to compare prices using my amazon app and see that it was $15 cheaper to buy through Amazon. He needed a new pair of &#34;work boots&#34; and these fit the bill. They still look nice enough to wear out and about wearing with regular jeans, but give his feet the protection that he wanted. Great shoe!
B000VX03GC Nice cool weather boot Reasonably priced, warm comfortable boot happy with the purchase, so comfortable no &#34;break in&#34; required. Nice casual winter hiking boot
B000VX03GC Great fit,& great price Was worried when I ordered them,that they might not fit right,but &#34;WOW&#34; put them on went to work,& my feet were warm,& comfortable,see how they last for a mid-ranged price boot,great price,& a great all around boot.
B000VX03GC Great Hikers These are Goretex lines hikers.  They fit very well and are very comfortable.  They do not require &#34;breaking in&#34;.  I ordered a pair of these for myself (Ladies size 7.5).  I loved them so much that when my son, 13,  wanted a pair, I knew just the pair (Mens size 11).  He wore them for the first time on an 11 mile hike.  He said they were very comfortable and he had no blisters.
B000VX03GC Not very impressed Was ok, but I didn't like the stain like &#34;design&#34;.it looks as if the front is faded out.. looks worn out!
B000VX03GC Shoe size misleading. Needed 2E or 3E as chart suggested they had. They sent a "W" instead, as shoe sizes not exact. Needed 2E or 3E as chart suggested they had in stock. They sent a &#34;W&#34; instead, as actual shoe sizes not exact.
B000VX03GC Great boot with a couple of exceptions You can read the other writeups for all the wonderful things about this boot.I returned it and here's why:1. The boot has absolutely no toe protection.  I mean it's so soft, you can feel your toes with your thumb thru the leather.  That's just too whimpy for the hiking I do.2. I wasn't thrilled with the sole.  I like a more aggressive pattern.3. The boot was REALLY wide in the &#34;W&#34; size.Comment:I have the Timberland Pro series which is almost identical to this boot.  It's a bit heavier and has the safety toe which I like.If you appreciate my comments, give the &#34;pro&#34; a look.
B000VX03GC Dry and surprisingly lightweight! I work outside, and am on my feet for at least half the day. I wear these 5 days a week, and on a mixture of grass, rock, and concrete.There is a seam on top of the boot, that hit right on one of my big toe &#34;knuckles&#34;. I was worried that these were going to have to be used rarely, but after a few weeks breaking in, the leather has loosened just enough that they feel great. One of my feet is a 10-3/4&#34; and the other is just under 10-1/2, so buying shoes is always an adventure. There is plenty of room in both boots, and they feel snug, but not tight. I've had them almost submerged in muck, and my feet stayed dry.The only concern I have, is the soles. In just over a month, the soles are already showing signs of wear. Granted, I put these things through Hades daily, but still, this shouldn't be happening already. I'm used to Vibram soles, and these aren't that. It's too bad really, because when the soles wear out, the rest of the boots will still be fine. Seems like a waste. If they wear better than I expect, I'll do an update on my review.
B000VX03WQ I will never buy boots online without a lifetime warranty. The boots are falling apart, they are garbage.From the first moment I put them on I could tell they looked odd.Dryness in random places. It looks like it was in a desert.They also started getting covered in a white dry reaction from whatever they used to coat them.I stopped wearing the shoes due to the the appearance of them.I purchased some weather coating, that may fix it. I have no ideaI have owned a pair of Tims Euro Hikers at all times for the past 16 years. I have never had to treat them before. Either someone shipped me a crap pair or Timberland boots are not what they were. I have not purchased a pair for about 5 years.Basically, I will never buy anything like this online ever again.&#34;Phones ringing Dude&#34;, &#34;Thanks Donnie&#34;.
B000VX03WQ Great boot but needs the tongue gusset Purchased this pair last Christmas but was not pleased that the tongue gusset was removed. My previous pair (old and worn out) had the tongue gusset.I use these boots primarily when I am &#34;weed eating&#34; (using a string trimmer to cut weeds) I am having to stop several times to remove my boots to dump out twig, sticks, and other trash out of my boots. What a pain!I  have purchased a pair of football shoe &#34;spats&#34; to pull over my boots to keep the trash out !!!I like everything about the boots except the missing gusset. This will be my last pair unless the gusset is restored.Thanks, Bill Arthur
B000VX03WQ Purchased since 1986 I have purchased Euro Hikers since 1986 and they have been my &#34;ONLY&#34; hiking boots I have purchased from Timberland or Any other company. Timberland is my &#34;ONLY&#34; hiking boot outfitter PERIOD !!
B000VX04DO great shoes!!! &#34;I bought these for my son at college as part of his winter uniform and he wears them every where, all the time. He says they are a great pair of sturdy, weather resistant boots and fashionable enough to wear casually. I would re-purchase.&#34;
B000VX04PC Love My New Tims!!! Break in is taking a little longer than norm but I still love them!! like the old adage says &#34;No Pain No Gain&#34;
B000X46MOQ disappointed about size i ordered a 7.5 wide, the low end of the size i wear but extra width for heavy socks, and the boot still fits snug across the toe and the heel is VERY big.  the side of the heel rubs my ankle even after i added a heel insole (no room in the toe for a whole insole!).  the boot definitely feels to me just like every other &#34;women's&#34; boot that is just a man's shape with a women's label.  disappointing at this price and timberland came very highly recommended.Pros:feet stayed warm and dry in snowy/wet conditions and boots did not feel heavy even after 10 hours in the field.
B000XEA5ZI Built to last. Best work boots I've ever had. Very happy with this product and I'd recommend them to anyone. Especially those of u (like me) that aren't going for the &#34;cowboy look&#34;.
B000XEA5ZI True to size, consider a wide if you are on the cusp. The length was perfect, I wish I had fine with the wide, a bit snug around the ball of the foot, but I am positive that as they break in they will be better. Very comfortable boot to walk in. Been using &#34;Steel Trax&#34; for 3 years now. I wear them 9-12 hours a day and my feet never hurt, they provide excellent support. I recommend buying these if you walk on hard surfaces a majority of the time. The toe also does not wear though, very big perk!
B000XEAA0S Great boots for the money I had a pair of the 6&#34; and loved them and wore them till they fell apart. They saved my toes many times. The 8&#34; are great as well!
B000XEACHO Very nice but not good as far as slip resistant Warm, comfortable and seem sturdy.  They do need some time to get broken in - no big deal.  The &#34;no slip&#34; isn't sufficient for wet, snowy and icy concrete.  I fell on my behind twice while carrying my daughter right when I got these.  If you are buying them for &#34;no slip&#34; look elsewhere.  But they seem to be great boots other than that.
B000XEACHO Work Boots &#34;Love Timberland in general, but these boots are so comfortable. I'm going to get two more.&#34; in words of my loving husband.
B000XEAM10 pretty good but not as good as the other titan i got these because i loved my 6&#34; titans (26078). they were the most comfortable boots iv ever owned. i thought these were basically the same boot but with the &#34;lace to toe&#34; style that i like a little better. they are not the same boot. i find them hard to get cinched tight enough on the heel which leaves a little too much wiggle room. they have got a little better with break in but never settled the way i would prefer. i'll go ahead and wear them out then go back to the other ones.
B000XEAMXS Great work boot I have been buying Timberland pro boots for years know because of the comfort and durability. I usually get at least a couple of years worth of usage out of them (sometimes longer). The sole is comfortable and it holds up to some of the chemicals I work around. I ussualy buy the steel toe model (light brown in color) but decided to try this composite model this time. There is never a &#34;break in&#34; period for me as they are comfortable out of the box. I will continue to buy Tinmberland Pro models for as long as the make them.
B000XEAPDA Not the detail I bought these for my husband, as he likes the Timberland brand, but these were tight around the toe area for him.  Also, it doesn't have the &#34;eye hooks&#34; to lace up the boot and not as strong in the lace up as his other ones, so we returned.  Nice looking, but not what he was looking for.
B000XEAPDA 100% Husband Approved Hubby works in a sawmill and finding comfortable steel-toed boots has been an expensive trial and error process over 32+ years. He would go to the local farmer's supply or purchase them off the &#34;boot bus&#34; and invariably his preferred model was discontinued or unavailable when he needed them. Too- certain mills have different protocols and/or wet environments that required additional protection. I began to shop for my personal shoes by reading the reviews and was pleasantly surprised to discover that Amazon customers know a thing or two about fit and comfort.... long story short- I convinced husband to allow me to order his boots by reading the reviews specific to his needs. Lo and behold! He's SOLD on not only the process but THIS BOOT in particular! He said it was the first time EVER he'd been able to wear a boot for a whole week without having to break it in. If he's this happy on his feet he may work another 30 years in the industry!
B000XEEW9S like a base ball glove Right off the &#34;get go&#34; ...out of the box....no break in ....like a base ball glove....they fit PERFECT. feel good at rest riding the Harley and Walking around for the arch in my feet.....nicccce. let's see how they hold up next 7 years :) they seem to be stiched well-built well.my old danners lasted 7 years and then the souls started falling apart. the danners never really ever fit well.
B000XEEW9S My 4th pair I love these boots, I think the first pair I bought was in 2008.  I'm a pro mechanic so spending a hundo for a &#34;tool&#34; that I'm using for 11 hrs a day 5 days a week that keep my feet happy is no big deal, This is the only boot I have found that has a 30 day comfort guarantee, and they feel broke in in a couple days. The Tractor Supply Co. stopped selling them so I reluctantly bought them without trying them on thru Amazon, and they fit and feel great.  Yes the sole will eventually seperate and get you socks wet. How long they last depends on many factors. For me about 1 year, I'll keep buying them as long as they continue to make them.
B000XEH2JA Most comfortable safety toe shoe I have ever worn. They never require &#34;break in&#34; and feel like tennis shoes.  Great boots!  As an added bonus they look nice too!
B000XEIZ7S Theyre the most comfortable "shoes" for flat feet ive worn Theyre the most comfortable &#34;shoes&#34; for flat feet ive worn.  Better than new balance. They work great and look good.  The leather over the steel toe is lighter and gets more scuffs but nothind bad so far.
B000XEIZ7S Very good boots Bought these boots to replace my pair I had for 10 years.  Fit perfectly, very comfortable, pretty lightweight for &#34;steel toed&#34; boots.  Highly recommend these for good looking work boots.
B000XEIZ7S For someone new to wearing "work boots" - these are a dream Let me start by saying that these are the first work boots I have ever worn. While I cannot therefore compare them to any other workboots, I can say with confidence that these boots are incredibly comfortable and made the transition from athletic / hiking shoes to work boots hardly noticable. They are not much heaver than my trail running / hiking sneakers. The fit is roomy in the toe box, comfortable but supportive around the heel. They do seem to run a bit long - I ALWAYS wear a size 13 and in these I could have sized down to a 12 (not even a 12.5!). The waterproofing is amazing and I have stood in 6&#34; of water. The non-slip soles just that - they have a very secure footing. And while some people have complained about breathability, I cannot support that complaint. I wear these with regular athletic socks and I do not find them overly hot, nor do I sweat profusely. Do they breathe as well as my asics? No. Do they breath as well as my 5.10 hiking shoes? Absolutely! The biggest thing that took getting used to was the height of the sole/heel. The sole under the toe is about 1.25&#34;, and the heel is easily 1.75&#34;! So I still find myself either high stepping when climbing stairs (to be safe), or kicking the front of the stair (when I forget to high step). But that is just a matter of time.If you are looking for a work boot that doesn't have that &#34;clunkiness&#34; that you hear about - these are the ones. Just size down! Seriously.
B000XEJ9V4 Not worth the price This style of Timberland, as with most Timberlands, looks really nice. This style however has no inner padding whatsoever. The soles don't last. Within 2 months the heel on my pair of boots was gone. You can get the same &#34;quality&#34; of boot from Payless and for a lot less. Until durability issues are resolved, I can't recommend these boots.
B000XEJ9V4 Just what I hoped for The boot has sturdy construction, waterproof, very nice sole support, and the extra 2&#34; height is perfect for tramping through the snow drifts.
B000XEKCRE Great Boots these boots are very comfortable right out of the box. you do not realize it is a safety toe boot! this is my 3rd pair. I am on my feet a lot in an industrial work environment and these boots are by far the most comfortable work boot I have ever used. make sure you get the 8&#34; boot. I have had a pair of the 6&#34; too and the 8&#34; are more comfortable. good looking and light, not bulky. hard to go wrong with timberland !
B000XEKCRE Best lightweight safety toe boots out there! This is my second pair.  These are the most comfortable boots I have even owned,  They are light enough that they also make great hiking boots.  I needed a lightweight safety toe boot for working around my farm and cutting firewood, along with taking hikes.  These fit the bill perfectly.  The reviews are correct that the sole wears faster than normal, but with my part time use I have managed 5 years out of my first pair which are still useable.  I recommend a set of &#34;Boot Savers&#34; (approx. $8.00) to glue on the toes.  These will prevent the toes from getting scuffed up and ruined.  Also, to keep dry I use &#34;Sno Seal&#34;- made from beeswax.  If you want lightweight and super comfortable, buy these.
B000XEKHOC Best winter boots Much better than Timberland 6&#34; Premium series: synthetic lining is more durable than leather one and and antibacterial treatment is good thing. But toe is not as wide as in  6&#34; Premium.
B000XEKHOC Expected More I wore these boots for about 6 months before the sole started coming off. I was shoveling snow and my feet got wet. I never used them for anything &#34;heavy duty&#34; either.
B000XEKHOC Timberland Mens shoes My husbands buys no other brand of shoe.  He loves Timberland and they fit great and feel great!!!  This is the first time he tried the &#34;no&#34; steel toe Timberland. They feel great!!!
B000XEKHOC Ordered For My Son I ordered the boots for my son because of Timberlands reputation for quality/warmth.  His feet stay warm during a 30 minute walk to school, and it gives him the &#34;cool&#34; winter look that teenagers go for now days.
B000XEKIUK Excellent Boot, great value! Surprisingly very comfortable and strong-looking footwear.  Be prepared to &#34;grow&#34; about seven (&) centimeters when you put these boots on -- the thick sole really elevates you off of the ground.I purchased my boots shortly after buying a pair for my son in the traditional yellow color.  He loves his boots.
B000XEKIUK A great buy They are definitely roomy compared to sneakers of size 12, but with thick winter socks they are just right. Bought these for my boyfriend, and he's over the moon! They are less expensive than the &#34;fashion&#34; timberlands, but more functional and just as stylish. He says they're warm and comfortable, and definitely get good traction on snow and ice.
B000XEKIUK Not a great boot for the price Bought these to work in.  I am a general contractor.  Not long after buying them the leather on the front of the boot started pushing back from the stitching at the toe where it connects to the sole.  There is 1/4&#34; to 1/2&#34; gap now between where the leather should be and where it is.  Leather will start separating from the sole now and the boots will be shot.  Leather wore through on the left toe within a couple weeks of getting them.  I've got Brahma boots I bought at Walmart that have held up better than these at half the price.  Cannot recommend these boots to anyone, even a light duty user.  Timberland used to be a good brand, not so much anymore.  Very disappointed.  Look elsewhere before you drop $100 on these boots.
B000XEKIUK Great boot-just not comforable Over all its a quality made boot. Why I gave it an &#34;ok&#34; rating: the insole b*ow$, like there really is't any point in it even being in there its so thin, it provides no support and no shock absorption/comfort. I have owned many pairs of boots, so I in no way had expectations of these guys feeling like my Nike's. Its a shame because they really are nice boots. My boots from shoes for crews were SO much more comfortable, they actually had a heal cushion in the insole. There were a few spots where the leather was damaged-not a big deal as these are work boots, but still-out of the box I would expect Timberland to want to take some pride in the product they deliver. **My works to Timberland: the mentality of &#34;profits over people&#34; doesn't work. Because yes, you my be able to &#34;save&#34; $xxx by cheapening up the insole quality, but at the end of the day a real person laces up those boots and goes to work. If your product suc*s they will find another that doesn't. Also, focusing on maintain the quality of the name that you have might be good too. I don't think the union shoe makers that made your boots here, back in the good ol' days when the American flag was still on the box would have sent out a product with glue stains and scratched leather. Just food for thought.
B000XEKIUK What more could you ask for?!! These weather proof boots are sturdy and add 2&#34; in height. LOL! They arrived quickly and as pictured. Our teenager has gone rock climbing in these boots and found the grip to be quite beneficial.
B000XEKK94 15 year old LOVES this boot Our 15 year old needed a work boot for a mission construction trip,  and he also needed a new winter boot.  With size 15 feet,  there aren't a lot of options, and the ones we did find didn't fit well.  These fit comfortably,  are warm,  and have &#34;the look&#34; he wanted.
B000XEKK94 The perfect teen boot for winter Bought as a gift for my 15-year-old who is in boarding school way up north and otherwise would probably have worn sneakers in the snow all winter.  He would not be caught dead in real snow boots.  Was well advised by another young person that this is &#34;the&#34; classic boot the kids wear.  15-year-old was THRILLED when he opened it on Christmas.
B000XEKK94 work boot I drive a truck and need a sturdy boot that will up hold well.  So far the boot has been waterproof, comfortable and warm on chilly days.  It only took a day or two to feel &#34;broken in&#34; and not so stiff and tight.
B000XEKK94 Answer to your &#34;Review on Purchases&#34; The boots are nice but I was very disappointed of the colour.I ordered wheat coulour (like show on this picture) but you sent me tan colour.
B000XEKK94 Great work boots! I bought these for my husband after he bought himself 2 pair of disappointing boots. After reading reviews for HOURS, I decided on these boots, they did not disappoint!The reasons for the decision: No &#34;hooks&#34; on the top laces(these tend to break), no stitching on the tongue, great/non-skid/gripper sole, reviews reported great insoles/support, and for a work boot, they look good...all these reasons held up when the actual product was received and put into use.The only con I can find is that my husband doesn't want to wear them when his worksite is too muddy because he is afraid he will &#34;ruin&#34; them and have to live without them ;-)My husband reported that these are the most comfortable pair of work boots he has ever owned(after working in transportation and construction fields for 20yrs, he's had MANY). He is an equipment operator and walks to/from equipment on various surfaces(unfinished bridges/girders, dirt, hills, etc) and they hold up well without causing pain in his feet. He WAS worried that I paid too much, but the amazon price was excellent(as always)!!Before buying these boots, my husband would come home from work 5 days of 6 complaining of his feet hurting and unable to walk anymore...life stunk! With these boots he is able to come home and still function...we go out to dinner again!! So they are an investment for me as much as him ;-)
B000XELF3O Awesome! My husband, the smarta$$, said they were really comfortable, easy to tie, fit perfectly (we used the sizing chart as a guide to make sure)  They offer good support for his feet and his knees don't hurt as much in them.  I dunno... it's what he said.  &#62;.&#60; In his own words, he adds: &#34;not too big, not too small, not too hard, not too soft, not too hot, not too cold...they're Juuuuuuust right&#34;&#62;.&#60; So, anyway, I bought them because Timberland has a REALLY good reputation.  They're durable and comfortable!  These are living upto Timberland's reputation :)
B000XELF3O Timberland for life! When I say &#34;fit as expected&#34; I've owned timberlands for over 15 years... Each pair is the same - 1 size smaller!! Always.... I wear a 12 in normal shoes and 11 in timbs.. Thought that was a known fact for timbs... Anyway, with sizing out of the way, it's an incredible boot. Lighter than my old pair..
B000XELF3O Dont fit right. I bought 2 pairs of these. The first pair was cut WAY too small. I ordered a size larger and my toes fit, but they are just made wrong. I tried to give it a month or so to &#34;break in&#34; but they still rub my ankles and toes wrong. Very disappointing product. Too many people buying these just for the name which drives up the cost. Very poor product.
B000XELF3O Comfort Although the boots fit as expected, it will take more time to get used to them as the leather is &#34;hard&#34; and will take time to loosen enough to feel comfortable walking in them.
B000XELF3O doesn't fit like my previous Timberland Pro Pitboss! I bought these for my husband, who is on his feet for 10hour work shifts.  He has had this exact brand and style before and loved them, and never needed to &#34;break them in&#34;.  These do not fit right, they rub his ankles and heels. He tried to duct tape his foot for over 2 weeks (to avoid blisters for the &#34;break in&#34; period) but has given up on them.  Not sure if they changed where or how they are manufactured, but we will never order Timberland Pro boots again, ever!  Now we are stuck with them since they were worn 2 weeks, and can't be returned. If you order them, please be aware that they aren't as they used to be, and returning after trying to unsuccessfully break them in, will get you nowhere.  This is one of the few negative reviews I have ever had to write on amazon....
B000XELF3O Ice skates are more comfortable. Day one: The heel cup dug into my ankle and by the end of the day I was limping. The toe box is kind of cramped. I don't have wide feet. I've never had to buy wide sizes, but these squash my toes together and put pressure in various places. And the &#34;comfort suspension&#34; sole? Is that a joke? This is the worst footwear I've encountered in 40 years. If I hadn't spent so much time trying to break them in, I'd return them. Ice skates would be more comfortable to wear all day.
B000XELF3O Good work boots... I've used these boots for many years.  Very comfortable, however, the last 2 or 3 pairs I've orders needed several days of wearing before they get broken-in.  I don't recall having some of the edges digging into my ankles before.  Also, the supposedly &#34;Wide&#34; sizes don't seem to be much wider than normal widths.  I wish the &#34;wides&#34; were a little wider for more toe room.
B000XELF3O Great pair of boots. I didn't know the product although I knew the brand name. So I took a chance, man pleasantly surprised, the fit was nice and comfortable, The quality of the shoe &#34;bar none&#34; the best I've come across, For the price! Can you tell I'm happy?
B000XELF3O Not the Timberland Pro I'm used to Its just not the same as the other pairs of Timberland Pro's that I've had (this is my 4th).Yes, they take a long time to break in.  It took me a month to break them in wearing them half the work day.  The heal was the most painful part.  There was a seam right up the middle that was very uncomfortable.The uppers are stiff.  During the first month I skipped the top lace.The toe is tight.  I have had regular width boots in the past and they have been a little narrow.  I bought wide this time and saw no improvement.Generally speaking, I wish I had listened to the other negative reviews.  All the Timberlands I've had previously came out of the box, onto my feet, and I said &#34;ahh, that is how they should fit.&#34;  This time it was out of the box, onto my feet, and &#34;ouch, these things are rough&#34;.
B000XETJU0 Working in comfort Great pair of boots so far. Very well made, nice sole, comfortable without any frills. They are not insulated which would be a little nicer, but I did not see that offered and have trouble finding good boots with a wide foot and size 12.I put them on the first day and have not had to change out them while &#34;breaking in&#34;.  Usually takes me a few weeks before I will let go of the old pair, not this time though.
B000XETJU0 Looks good but ... This is why I am reluctant to buy shoes over without trying them on.  Wore them and the outside cut into my ankle.  Painful and hope I can tough it out and they eventually &#34;break in&#34;.  Uggg.
B000XETJU0 I've been wearing these boots for years, and Amazon always has the best price. The first time I ever bought a pair of Pit Boss 6in SOFT TOE was about 8 years ago.  Ever since then I've been hooked.  The quality is awesome - they are triple stitched - I've never had a &#34;blow out&#34; - they fit great right out of the box.  They are also true to size.  These boots are an easy $115 - $120 in any mall store.  There's no reason to buy them anywhere but Amazon, they're exactly what you get at the store...not seconds or something like that.
B000XETJU0 Sturdy, comfortable boot Of course, the real test of a boot is how it WEARS and how it functions under challenges (mud, rain, etc.) and I really haven't had much chance to experience any of that yet with these boots... but they do seem well-made and sturdy, and they fit well and are more comfortable than the (different brand) workboots that they replaced.  They are a little on the heavy side, which kinda surprised me, because they're &#34;soft toe&#34; boots and not &#34;steel toe&#34; ones... I'm not sure that will be a problem though... I intend to use them for gardening and yard work mostly, not for hiking or anything...
B000XETJU0 It's gonna work! The Timberland PRO Men's Pitboss 6&#34; Soft-Toe Boot,Wheat, in size 13 W,  is just what I wanted!  I need to wear the boots around the house some to break them in before I go out into the real world though.  I have a foot problem that requires that process.  Good buy, too!!
B000XETJU0 one Timberland PRO Men's Pitboss 6&#34; Soft-Toe Boot,i like it .but i think it has a little old-fashioned . , ,
B000XETU1I Great Buy!!! I found these for my boyfriend as he is on his feet all day. In his words &#34;what a difference&#34; and &#34;very comfortable&#34;. Intially purchased a 10, which is his normal size but ran big. With easy return we had the 9.5 in a few days. Great service and product!
B000XETU1I I love timberland boots but these are not worthy of the name DO NOT CONFUSE these withTimberland PRO Men's 6&#34; Soft Toe Endurance Boot. Huge difference. I thought they were comparable because of some of the reviews I read. If your serious about good boots these are not it. I know good work boots: red wing, georgia, wolverine and my favorites Timberland PRO Men's 6&#34; Soft Toe Endurance Boot. Waist of a 100 bucks.
B000XEVLF6 kind of small &#26377;&#28857;&#23567; &#30475;&#26469;&#28023;&#28120;&#20080;&#38795;&#36824;&#26159;&#35201;&#27604;2E&#26356;&#23485;&#30340;&#12290;kind of small in width. I've ordered 2e width but I found it still kind of narrow in toe part. plus the &#34;steel toe&#34;, it is a problem after time wearing.
B000XEVLF6 I want two more pair's. These shoes fit perfect into the toe strap pedal thing's for my mountain bike, I thought I would never find a shoe worthy to ridewith Me. These Timberland have everything they are supposed to, steel toe, eye hook's, and the&#34; loop&#34; thing in the back we can actually put our finger&#34; in&#34; to use what it is there for. The shoe is also so very comfortable to wear that I can think. (kind of).please excuse my badd grammar.Does &#34;Timberland&#34;  make 3/4 steel toe hiking shoe's?  same Sapphire,would be nice, tyvvm please send world of warcraft game time. battlettag Hammerkill 1755
B000XEVLF6 Great Work Shoe! I've been working in a machine shop for over 7 years where steel toe or &#34;safety toe&#34; shoes are required.  I've always like Timberland Pro work boots with the composite toe, but I've never tried a &#34;shoe style&#34; before.  I have very &#34;beat up&#34; feet from my days in the Army Infantry and I am very picky on what shoes I wear, but after trying these Mudsill shoes by Timberland Pro, I will never wear anything else for safety toe shoes.  they are light weight, comfortable, and require no breaking in.  Usually a new pair of work boots has to be broken in over a two to three week period before you can really tell if they fit right, but these fit perfect on day one and have stayed perfect for a couple months now!  I would recommend these to anyone who needs a comfortable, light, sporty, outdoorsy, safety shoe.  I wear them for my daily shoes outside of work too because they are that comfortable!
B000XEVLF6 Perfect fit not to tight My husband bought these for work and loves them he said they are not like the typical new shoes that are tight and need &#34;broken in&#34;.
B000XEVLF6 Honesty These shoes are &#34;factory seconds&#34;. You should be up front about it.IInstead it is  noted on the  box in an obscure place in very small letters. Shame on you. Thats no way to do business,
B000XEVLF6 So far so good I purchased these for an employee that walks a lot.  He is a &#34;big&#34; boy and we have trouble finding boots in his size and that will last.  He is going on 2 weeks and so far so good, he walks about 3 to 4 miles per day and has no complaints so far.
B000XEVLF6 Work or Play Great fit, great look,great performance so far. Low cut is very versatile.  &#34;Tim PRO&#34; say no more!! Get yours now!
B000XEVM50 Great shoe, I just ordered the wrong size. As with the pair of Nautilus shoes I ordered along with these, I've never worn Timberland shoes before. I guess I wear a size 15 in steel toe and not a 14 because these were just a tad small in the toe box (and they were 14W). The shoes otherwise felt great and were super comfortable. Although, I live in Florida and these are pretty heavy and don't seem like they breathe too easily, which is why I didn't order a 15 in place of the 14. I work indoors and outdoors and need something that allow my feet to breathe. I hate when people put 4 stars because of their own error, but I can't really say, &#34;I love it&#34; since I returned them due to my error. They're definitely a 5-star shoe.
B000XEVM50 Look and Fit nice I got these to replace my old beige classic steel toed work boots. I use them for basic yard work and light snow days. They fit fine and look nice. Don't be deceived by the &#34;sneaker&#34; look of these... they are heavy and stiff and I wouldn't personally wear them as a daily walking shoe.
B000XEVM50 My Feet are Protected These are a comfortable and light &#34;Steel-Toed&#34; shoes, good for us who do a lot of walking on the job. The shoes feature a&#34;Non-Slip&#34; sole and can handle both dry and wet surfaces. They're reasonably priced and they look good too!
B000XEVM8W Pretty decent work boots I just got these 1 month ago.. They are pretty decent. They are not overly comfortable, but they are WORK BOOTS for a reason. I can already tell you the first thing that is going to wear out on these boots.. the rubber &#34;flap&#34; on the front of the boots. That is ALWAYS the first thing that wears out. I wish Timberland didn't put that on these boots, but oh well.
B000XEVM8W A pretty stiff boot but seems durable I wear a 13.5/Wide and thought this would be a good fit, but the toe was a bit too tight and so I guess this is an &#34;order one size up&#34; recommendation (not a half-size up).
B000XEW60K Comfortable shoe, needs very little breaking in I am a pretty standard size 12 wide foot and found this shoe to be about a half size too large.  The shoe is comfortable, and because it is apart of Timberland's &#34;PRO series&#34; they come with a 30 day comfort fit guarantee.  I have had these shoes for a little more than 30 days and have found that they have held up very well.  The heel is stiff enough to not colapse when you are trying to slide them on, but is not too stiff to be uncomfortable.  I would buy them again!
B000XF04LM Not Wide Shoe was supposed to be &#34;wide 2E&#34; but was considerably narrow!  My foot was squeezed on the sides and it seemed like my foot was hanging over the side of sole.
B000XF04LM Does not last. I am the general maintenance guy for a nursing center. I work 40hours weeks with a nice variety of sitting, standing, kneeling, and lying down to work under equipment. These shoes are comfortable and look good with jeans or carhartts. (I was hoping they would look good with Carhartt Shorts but my girlfriend quickly informed me they were not acceptable with shorts.Purchased &#34;Timberland PRO Men's Titan&#34; for $107.74 on August 30, 2012Within 3 months the toes were destroyed from when i was kneeling to work on something, I purchased some Gorilla brand Toe protectors to glue on and hide where the steel toes were easily visible. This solved my problem and i was quickly back to whistling while i work.Less than 2 months later (Writing this review 6 months after purchase. The sole of my left shoe is completly split along the arch. If i step in a puddle or even walk in medium rain my socks get wet.I ended up switching back to my &#34;Hi-Tec Men's Altitude&#34; boots which are cheaper and older. But still have far more life left than these do.Purchased &#34;Hi-Tec Men's Altitude&#34; for $82.7 on March 17, 2011Overall if you dont kneel or lie down on the floor for your job, or you want some slick looking boots to wear very seldomly, These are for you. If you want something that will last. Look elsewhere.
B000XF04LM Best steel toe work shoes I've owned As title says,  best I have every owned.  I work in a 12 hour department nearly on my feet the entire time.  They are absolutely comfortable and needed no &#34;break in&#34; period.  They hold up great to strong oils and other nasty fluids I come in contact with.  I have recommended these to everyone I know.  I defiantly recommend you buy these ASAP, you will not regret it.
B000XF04LM Awesome &#34;Great shoes! I love them!&#34;
B000XF4D1Y Akward These i got for my husband, he has wide feet and hates to shop, so i buy most of these things for him. I asked him &#34;why aren't you wearing your new shoes&#34;, that's when he showed me his bruised ankle. The shoes hit DIRECTLY at the ankle. He's chaffed like he had a diaper rash. Unfortunately, because he is not one to stir up stuff, he keep it secret. When he asked for new shoes with more coverage. That's when i figured out, he just wasn't wearing them. It should be above the ankle, these are not.
B000XF4D1Y snow and ice For my job I work both inside and outside. I am very satisfied with the comfort and wear of these shoes and would continue to wear them if I only worked inside.  However, when it come to walking on snow or ice they are quite useless.  Almost unsafe.  Were I work I call them the &#34;Slip Indicator Factor&#34;  If I slip on the walkways around the buildings then it's time to apply salt or sand to the sidewalks.
B000XF4D1Y Great Shoes...! Buying shoes on line has its moments, however living out in the country were could I possibly see so many different styles of shoes and never leave the house...?  &#34;NOWARE&#34;...Rich.
B000XR2GN4 Great boot on concrete and steel but deceptive ad. This is my second pair of the same boot.  The first pair lasted nearly seven years.  I do not appreciate the word &#34; coffee&#34; in your ad when the choice goes to &#34;brown&#34; for the price you advertised.  Coffee &#34;is&#34; color and it is $105. I expected coffee not brown!
B000XR2GN4 not what they appear to be Hugely dissapointed with these. Very cheap looking. Soft and squishy upper. Feet feel unsupported. Cant believe these are Timberlands. I give these about three months till they hit the dumpster. For me, a very expensive mistake. The only thing thing that looks &#34;PRO&#34; about these are the eyelets. These are definately K- mart quality items. Red Wing from now on. BEWARE!
B000XR2GN4 light and comfortable I've owned several pairs of these boots. I have wide feet with high arches. These fit great right out of the box, are true to size (wides), and they're very lightwieght. I used to wear the &#34;wheat&#34; colored ones, but now the only ones I could find are the dark brown. Ugly, but still comfortable. Yes, the soles WILL split across the ball of the foot. This sucks. It turns a 4-year boot into a 1-year boot. I wish that they would correct this problem, and bring back the lighter color.
B000XR2GN4 Run Big but a great walking boot I am a delivery driver who does route that pick up large amount of paper for secure document destruction. I do a lot of walking: up steps, on concrete and climbing through attics and basements where people store &#34;important&#34; stuff. I also do some moderate home remodeling via word-of-mouth on the side.These boots are some of the best for a versatile and comfortable boot. The leather comes very soft, yet durable for a quick break in time and the foot-bed has plenty of support to absorb the impact from concrete. However, these are some of the lightest durable boots I've owned. If available at the time as soon as these wear out I will be looking for them again. All around a great boot if you want something durable and comfortable for walking, lifting, moderate construction.
B000XR2W1U Excellent boots! This is the first work boot I've ever owned that I didn't have to &#34;break in&#34;. They fit so comfortably right from the beginning. I think I've found my &#34;forever&#34; boot. This will be the only one I'm planning on purchasing from now on out. Highly recommend!
B000XR2W1U the boots were not made for my feet My last purchase was another brand and was a size 9. They fit perfectly. Yours was large enough that I used insoles and &#34;work&#34; socks. With this combination they fit Later the eye on the right shoe began to dig into my ankle.
B000XR30FM Not much wear yet, but gorgeous boots. The picture on Amazon doesn't really do these boots justice. They are a little on the &#34;pretty&#34; side for work boots, and that's just fine! I choose Timberland because they always fit my feet better than any other boot, and require no breaking in time. These are not the exception to that expectation. They fit and feel great!
B000XXGMRO we're the planeteers you can be one too! my first impression was &#34;these boots are gunna be responsible for someone getting pregnant.&#34; Very stylish and comfortable. The sole does wear down fast. ive worn these about 5 times and i can see the wear already. i ordered a half size down should have went 1 whole size down but the extra room is perfect for doubling up socks.
B000XXGMRO Great boot... for the price. Received these boots about two weeks ago, I wanted to take them for a spin before leaving a review. All is well. I bought a size 9, I am a size 9 1/2, per the other reviews. This size worked for me, not to tight and not too loose. There is plenty of room to throw on some wool socks if need be, which I recommend due an added comfort factor, or just regular cotton socks. I work in an office and am on my feet all day, I can't tell with these puppies on. These boots are pretty awesome. However... like I said, I have had these for two weeks and I noticed the tiniest crack in the front of the sole, and one of the &#34;+&#34; treads popped off. I was pretty mad, but you can't expect perfection with certain recycled materials. I have a fix for it, so it's no big deal. We'll see how it goes.
B000XXGMRO Very loose, but well made and sharp looking. I'm between a 10-1/2 and 11 in most shoes/boots. These were advertised as &#34;true to fit&#34; so I ordered the 10-1/2, thinking boots always wear a bit large. Well, the 10-1/2 are huge, I had to return them and order size 10s which fit much better. They are loose though, the toes are reinforced but everything else is very soft leather, nice and smooth. Let's see how they hold up over time.
B000XXGMRO Good buy Like many people suggested and I ignored, go down one size unless you plan on wearing thick socks! The boots are very sturdy and have a &#34;worker&#34; look to them. I've had them for 2 weeks now, and the stitching on the tongue is already coming loose. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning them and waiting again, so I am willing to live with it. Other than that, I really can't complain because they still feel and look great. No insoles needed, I am on my feet for 8 hours a day and haven't had any problems yet...besides smelly feet, but that's my fault :) haha. I have not tested to see how waterproof they are, but can't wait for the Chicago snow to try it...I will probably regret writing that.
B000XXGMRO No Break In Period!! The reviews were right,  no break in period! I were a size 12.  I'm 6'1&#34; 190 lbs and these boots are super comfortable.  They ran a bit larger than I'm used to, but that's O.K. because this extra space allows you to wear extra socks in colder weather.I originally bought the Thorohgood American Heritage 6&#34; Boots, but they were even bigger than these Timberlands and too heavy.  Same Price but I needed something lighter to walk and hike in.But I only gave it 4 stars because the sole does wear out sooner than expected.  I've worn them almost every day for work since I've received them. And I do a lot of walking around. I got them back in Aug 2013.They were not that expensive and worth every penny!!!Don't think twice get them
B000XXGMRO Ultra comfortable and beautiful leather in french we say: &#34;comme dans des chaussons&#34;, that means those boots ar incredibly comfortable.They are beautiful too!, the leather is solid and soft. I love those boots.
B000XXGMRO High Quality This boot is what you are looking for if you like high quality. I &#34;used&#34; to wear Polo boots but not anymore. The Earthkeepers are light and they have an outstanding grip on the ground. Wear these boots with some starched jeans and you become the man.
B000XXGMRO Excellent Boots when you find the right size....****1 SIZE TOO LARGE**** These boots are awesome except that they do run ****1 SIZE TOO LARGE***. I ordered my normal boot size at 10.5 and found out like many others that they run a whole size too LARGE. I ended up returning them (Amazon is always great at returns) and ordered another pair at a 9.5 size. Much better!As far as quiality...I've owned many Timberland boots and love them. Last pair I had (different style) lasted 9 years! But i've only been wearing these for about a week and they break in quick and are comfortable.Love the high ankle on the boot...supportive without being too &#34;rigid&#34;.Color was as expected and looks great with just about everything.I know if your like me you'll buy them in your usual shoe size and say &#34;I'm sure they'll fit with big socks&#34; or &#34;let me just get this size first and try it&#34;. I am here to tell you that going down a size I still have a little room for winter socks but enough room to move my feet without big socks (don't like my toes to be crunched in).Don't make the mistake...JUST ORDER A SIZE DOWN FROM WHAT YOU NORMALLY GET.
B000XXGMRO A few nitpicks keep this from being 4 or 5 stars... Ok, so first the good:They look great.They seem sturdy enough for my intended use.  That is to say, daily wear and &#34;casual&#34; hiking.  I have my doubts that they would hold up under very rugged conditions, but then again, I didn't buy them for any sort of aggressive hiking conditions. I'll wear my Merrells for that.The leather is surprisingly soft right out of the box.  This was nice as the boots required almost no breaking in time, unlike almost all other leather boots I've bought.  Within a few days of purchase, I wound up wearing them at an all day photo shoot.  They were comfortable all day long and, most importantly, by the time I got home, my feet were not screaming at me.Now the nitpicks:Prior to purchase, I read a number of reviews complaining about the sizing.  I'm glad I did.  Based on what others said, I ordered a half-size smaller than normal (I went with a size 10, instead of my usual 10.5).  Even then, the boots feel just a tad on the large size -- not enough to justify going down a half a size again, but just a touch more roomy in the toes than I'd like. If I were going to do any sort of aggressive hiking in these, I don't feel like I'd have a good feel for the trail due to the extra &#34;play&#34; in the toe area.The second nitpick is that there appears to be a defect with the sole on the left side.  The toe &#34;squishes&#34; when I step, as though air is rushing out.  It did this right out of the box, so I know it was nothing I did to the boot.  Like the sizing issue, it's not enough of a problem to justify a return, but it's a disappointing lapse in quality.  If the soles wear out as quickly as some other reviews suggest, this problem will take care of itself when I have theme resoled.  But this shouldn't be an issue with brand new shoes to begin with.
B000XXGMRO It's a very nice shoe I feel the quality is quite good and the shoes feels soft and comfortable.My feet is 40, and 6&#34; fit me well.
B00110CR1S Good looking boots! I'm a lucky woman who can wear boys shoes.After reading some reviews I decided to order a half size bigger than my actual size for my wider feet.When I receive the box my first reaction was &#34;oh no it's big! This looks like reg mens shoe box!&#34;But then I was wrong.The boots look better than pictures and they fit very well!I highly recommend this boots for women with wide feet who can wear boys size!Thank you Timberland.btw my cat is keeping the box!
B001760K56 Poor Quality Leather/zippers The negatives: The quality of the leather was very poor - both boots had several white scratches on the leather upon arrival which could not be rubbed out. Also, the leather just looked &#34;cheap&#34;. The zippers were very cheap and did not zip up/down easily - they kept catching. I went back online and looked at more of the reviews for this boot and found that several other people had problems with the zippers too.The positives: the boots were comfortable and they had a very good sole with excellent traction. However, those positives didn't outweigh the negatives for me so I sent them back.For an alternative to the Timberland boot, I would recommend the Portlandia &#34;Beacon&#34;  boot. I tried these boots on at a local shoe store and found them to be even more comfortable than the Timberland boots, looked very cute on,  but unlike the Timberland, the quality was excellent on the Beacon. I ordered them online (it was much cheaper than my local store - however, I would shop around because the price I paid was $100 less than some online vendors. AMAZON did not carry the Beacon, and I would have ordered the &#34;Ballard&#34; which had the same foot bed as the Beacon, but it did not come in my size). The foot bed of the Beacon was modeled on the Dansko clog, so if you find Danskos comfortable, you might really like the Beacon. BTW, the Beacon looks much better in person and on the foot than it does on a computer monitor. Also, It's hard to tell on the computer, but the decorative strap towards the bottom of the boot is suede, while the rest of the boot is leather.
B001760K56 Nice but not for me. After reading reviews I was sure these were &#34;the ones&#34;.  Sadly no.  I ordered a 9 1/2, my regular size but they fit more like a 10 1/2 making my already lg feet look like clown shoes.  Reviews did say they ran lg but I thought it would leave room for winter socks, wrong.  I have 14&#34; calves so the 14 1/2&#34; quoted should have been OK.  In this size the inside measures 15&#34;.  I used a flexible seamstress tape to measure.  Tightening the strap at the top of the boot just made the leather buckle and ruined the look.I feel that even if I had chosen a smaller size, 9, the foot would look huge and unattractive.  As I live in Canada, the expense of reordering is not feasable, I will look elsewhere, in person. The boots are beautifully made, the leather is gorgeous but just were not meant for me.  They'll be going back.
B001760K56 Shaft shorter and wider than advertised I have been looking to replace my beloved perfect boots that I finally walked into the ground after 4 long winters--sleek tall leather shaft with a lug sole and 2&#34; heel--only to find that the wide calf is the new normal.  These Timberland Lexis Boots came half way--nice leather, good lug sole. But the 14.5&#34; advertised circumference was over 15&#34; and the shaft height was barely 14&#34; (not the 15&#34; as advertised).  My search continues. I hope I don't have to go to Europe. as my son suggests, to find a winter hardy, fashionable boot for slender calfs!  If you have short sturdy legs, these are for you.
B001C4CIP8 Great boots These are replacing my 2 year old timberland pro boots which model name escapes me. This is my first pair of &#34;mining boots&#34; and never had the metatarsal guard in any other pair. Right now they are not broken in and still feel stiff. However, they fit as I expected for my size 15w and I like the 10&#34; boot better than the 8&#34; boot. I especially love black. The outer material is well protected and will hold up better than regular leather bots. The toe guard is great for protecting the outside since my old non protected has the steel toe showing through the leather. I'm very happy and once I get them a little worn in they will be great!
B001EBA784 GREAT BOOTS Bought these for my husband who walks around job sites almost every day all day.  He LOVES them.  He is very picky and alot of shoes &#34;hurt&#34; his poor little feet ;), but he says these feel great all day!  He has also said that they keep his feet warm and dry.  Also I think they look great and very manly.
B001EWFF30 Plug and play Many people say &#34;work in your boots before you go for a long hike.&#34; You don't need to with these Timberlands. I laced them up and went on a 5-miler in Sedona and it was almost as comfortable as wearing running shoes but a heckuva lot studier.My only very very small quibble is I think I should have gotten an 11 instead of a 10.5, but then again on the hike I was wearing two pair of socks. I prefer a snug fit generally.We'll see how durable they are, but from a comfort standpoint, these have turned out to be just what I'd hoped.
B001FXZU92 great boots Great boots very comfortable! A little heavy but you don't notice. 1-10 rating on comfort they are a 11 and no &#34; break in&#34;
B001FXZU92 Heavier than expected. According to my husband, they are &#34;heavy boots, but durable,&#34;. He goes through work boots about every six month and bought these same boots before. They have upgraded/changed the style by adding a rubber toe guard in the front. On his old pair, this is the part that eventually tore so we were happy about the design change for durability. However, the boots are significantly heavier (and for him to say anything it must be a pretty big deal).
B001FXZU92 Seem pretty rugged, on the heavy side. When you first get them you'll notice how heavy the box is. Super sturdy feeling boot when you first hold one in your hands, you just feel like it can take some abuse. On that note, they do seem to be rather heavy compared to some others but it's got some steel flexplate inside to protect you from punctures and a steel toe. When I first put them on, I really wasn't feeling the comfort I was hoping for and was immediately disappointed. Co-worker said &#34;Give them a few days&#34; and sure enough on the 2nd day, for me anyway, they felt 10x better. Now it's just a question of &#34;How long are these gonna last me?&#34;. My work mainly is comprised of a step ladder for pretty much every job, constant moving around and I have this thing where I sit on my feet instead of my knees when doing floor level work. This obviously takes a toll on the outsides of my boots but most have survived with maybe an eyelet hook of some sort squeezing shut or breaking altogether.
B001FXZU92 Super Comfortable for a workboot These boots are absolutely wonderful.  They are super comfortable and feel like I have worn them everyday for 6 months right out of the box.  They also are very well made and look like they will last forever (although I have only had them a couple weeks).  The only &#34;ding&#34; I would give them is that they are pretty heavy.  I ordered them having never seen/tried them on, which is normally something I would do.  If weight is a concern, I would definately recommend finding a local store that carries them and check them out, then save yourself some cash and order them online.
B001PBK87I Timberland Boots Great fit and comfort.  Although I live in PA I could not find any 8&#34; boots anywhere, including at the Timberland Outlet Store.
B001SARJXC Disappointed Appearance is fine -- better than expected -- but the fit and the quality of manufacture was disappointing.  The footbed had ridges and grooves that were very uncomfortable.  Replacing the footbed with a Superfeet insert was impossible because some of the structure of the shoe was in the original footbed itself.  Removing the stock footbed also disclosed a &#34;lug&#34; sole and heel that was simply a thin layer of composite material molded into an apparent lug sole and heel; the &#34;lugs&#34; were hollow, and would probably wear out quickly.  Had it been a $30 shoe at a Payless, okay -- understandable quality.  But for $100, not acceptable.  Would not recommend it -- pretty obviously -- except for the appearance -- which was quite good.
B001SARJXC Horrible My husband bought these because he has the same pair and loves them.  He got these and could tell immediately that they were definitely not as well made as the ones he had purchased in the store.  The &#34;leather&#34; tab on the back tore the first time that he put them on! Then the sole separated after just a couple of wears.  Took them to our nice little shoe repair man who told us that they were not even worth repairing.
B001SARJXC Comfortable, waterproof, pull on strap broke after 3rd time wearing them I like them, but the pull on strap broke after wearing them only three times.  I have other &#34;Chelsea&#34; boots for years and no such breakage.
B001U0OTCY Good Boots These boots are for my husband. He says &#34;These boots are good they keep my feet warm. The sizing is a bit off in my opinion. They are also hightop shoes. They come up far past my ankle and I am not a fan of that. They are comfortable and durable in the snowy weather&#34;
B001U0OTCY Love these! These are a must have! I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear these. Everybody wants to know, &#34;where did you get those&#34;...these are VERY comfortable and stylish at the same time. The instillation inside keeps your feet super warm.
B002618DBE Sturdy, waterproof boot We are on the second pair of these boots for our about to turn 3-year-old daughter.  Companies just don't make waterproof hiking boots in toddler girl sizes, and these are the most unisex option we can find.  (No &#34;girl colors&#34; on the boot, but no &#34;boy colors&#34; either.)  They have kept her comfortable and dry while out on the trails and while standing in mud puddles .  Only time she's had wet feet is when she has gone in too deep or splashed so hard that water has gone in the top.  Highly recommend!
B00261CDYW Fungus Green The picture makes the &#34;olive&#34; green look reasonable! I figured I'd try something new with green, but when it arrived I immediately returned it. Not Olive green, more &#34;pumpkin fungus&#34; green...even had similar texture rotten fruit!
B00295RJIU Comfy and supportive Comfy shoe overall - only wish it wasn't as &#34;mushroom&#34; shaped.  Fit it great, support while working long hours is terrific, so can't complain.
B0029XG3OS GREAT COMFORTABLE WORK BOOT Bought these for my bf who is in construction. We shopped around retail stores but hard to find just the right boot for his needs. On a whim,  I saw these boots and they had everything he was looking for such as steel toe, puncture resistant bottom, insulated inside, odor control, high ankle support and anti -fatigue, not to mention a specially designed bottom which allows for greater grip when climbing ladders. Timberland thought of everything for the working man with these boots.  Long story short, he Loves them!Be aware that because of all these added &#34;extras&#34; these are a bit weighty. However, according to him, worth it.  Also, order 1/2 size up from your normal work boot as they run a little smaller, especially if you wear heavy socks. Normally he wore redwing boots but didn't have the 250-300 bucks at the time. These were a great alternative and he is quite happy with them.
B0029XG5YG TImberland PRO 14" Mining Boot I bought these boots for work and selected the 14&#34; height because they will keep my legs warm during the cold rides home on my motorcycle. I received these boots this week and have been wearing them around the house to see if I want to commit to keeping them. I prefer to buy shoes/boots that I have tried on instead of through the net to ensure a good fit. Yet these are fine so far! I do wear a thicker &#34;steel toe&#34; sock so putting the boot on is a bit difficult but I expect that to change over time. The internal met-guard is not as tight as I thought it would be. It was tight during the initial time I put the boot on, but I did not open up the laces far enough to provide the room. No tightness during wearing though.After wearing them around the house the last three days I have decided to keep them as they are a comfortable boot. I did fill out the online survey regarding the boot and will again when Timberland sends me the 30 day survey. I will then also update my review on these.I do not work in a mine but for my state department of transportation and encounter situations which I feel are pretty abusive to my boots, such as salt, salt brine, asphalt, tar, oil, grease, water, cleaning chemicals, and more. I want these boots to last at least two years. The concerns I have regarding the boot is the &#34;rubber&#34; strip that goes around the boot near the ankle. How long will that last before it cracks and breaks? The same with the tongue material. Will that start cracking and ripping in less than one year?So far so good. I hope the &#34;good&#34; continues!
B0029XG5YG optimistic So far so good.Fit perfectly.  Comes with extra laces,  which I tend to go through quickly.My last &#34;miner&#34; boot lasted a year before I had to start gluing it back together.  Lets hope these hold up better.I wear these, or any, boots daily.  I'm mostly white collar but engage in daily projects that include welding, digging, demolition,  construction,  concrete work....A successful boot will give me 1 1/2-2 years trouble free. Very few ever make it. Here's to hoping timberland will do it!
B002ASAJPG Great Anti-Fatigue work boots I bought a pair of these exact boots last year and was surprised I could find them again.  They were comfortable the first time I put them on and felt &#34;broken in&#34; by the second day.  I live in (rainy) Oregon, do lots of walking and truck driving back & forth to job sites and these boots are still water proof, durable and comfortable.  If you want to alternate 2 pairs of boots every day to make them last as I do, these are THE ones to have.
B002ASAJPG Timberland PRO Men's Endurance PRO Waterproof 6" Work Boot First off the delivery was on time and just perfect for me since my old shoes (Dr. Martens) needed replacing after four years and well I never had a 6&#34; boot before so this was the best choice going solely on a previous product experience with Timberland (not the Pro series).The look and feel of the boot really gives off a product that is well made, sturdy and will last a long time. Naturally I buy these type of boot (steel toes, industrial standard ratings, etc.) for their durability and have had experience with several brands before which have lasted just about the same period or a little more than the Dr. Martens. Basically I don't have to go investing in a boot every year or two.The boots were true to my size fitting....different brands do have different sizing so measure your feet...and I must say these boots are heavy when you first take them out of the box and heavier than anything that I've worn before. After a few days of wearing....which surprisingly didn't require any breaking in...I hardly notice the weight &#34;effect&#34; of them on my feet since I'm on my feet all day. The insides are comfortable to my feet and keep them snug and dry having exposed them to heavy rainy weather over the period that I've tested their endurance in.Durability was the reason behind buying these boots so price was never a determinant since I knew these would last a while and the investment for me should go a long way...so I guess sometimes one must sacrifice the $$$ for quality...I would definitely recommend these and will also purchase another pair before Timberland discontinues this series in the future.
B002ASAJPG I recommend you buy a pair of these once a year. World's comfortable work shoes but doesn't last... I have several foot pain issues. Plantar Fasciitis, a steel heel (surgery), arthritis and sometimes gout. Well, there is no footwear in the world for gout.&#34;Straight out of the box comfort!&#34;I've worked in constructions for nearly 20 yrs I've used these shoes for last 5yrs (a pair every year) after trying many many others. Yes, I'm overweight and that contributes to increased wear. Sears carries this product but not always available in my size, fortunately I discovered Amazon & the wonderful world of the internet, you can purchase just about anything. It's steel toe so choose 1/2 size larger. And if you're overweight, make sure to get this in Wide. &#34;E&#34; means width of shoe
B002ASAJPG Yes, they are steel-toed shoes, so they are heavy I had a pair of Timberland boots from the 90s that I kept around for yard work and even though the soles were very worn down, I kept going back to them compared to other &#34;replacement&#34; boots I bought in between. So I finally went for it and bought these from Amazon. I wanted the waterproof membrane and ended up with this pair for that even though I would not have necessarily gone for steel-toed boots.They fit well, and you get used to the extra weight. It is hard to beat Timberland work boots for quality and durability.
B002ASAKN2 Worry Free Sizing I wanted these boots, and I was afraid to order them because of the comment about sizing.  I.e. I understood the boots were not matching up with the expected sizes.I am cheap and I do not want to pay to ship them back if they are not the correct size.  I learned that returns for the wrong size are entitled to free return shipping.  With that in mind, I placed my order &#34;WORRY FREE.&#34;My boots arrived quickly and the fit was exactly as I expected/wanted.  I wanted a 10 wide and I got a 10 wide.  Perfect fit.  I have worn Timberline boots since I was a kid, and I know the quality is second to none.I give 5 stars for quality/reputation, &#34;Worry Free&#34;  Free Return shipping charges, quick delivery, and the 30-day satisfaction guarantee.  &#34;No matter what happens, I can't lose.&#34;  I get a great boot that looks good and a warranty second to none.
B002ASAKN2 well made They are very comfy....but when you see your feet with shoes ON, looks smaller and less wide. Not sure it make any difference because these are described as &#34;WorkBoots&#34; not party wear :)
B002ASAKN2 Best Workboots Ever I bought these for my son and he absolutely loves them.  In his words, &#34;these boots rock!&#34;  They are like walking on marshmallows!
B002ASAKN2 Comfort for Sure Been looking at this boot for almost a year at the local stores that carry it. However NONE OF THEM carry the black colored ones. This is the first piece of clothing I have ever bought online (other than a motorcycle helmet).No matter what is for sell in the world, there's always a lemon to be had. I think some of the negative &#34;quality&#34; reviews in here are simply someone that got a lemon. I predominately bought mine for riding my dual sport motorcycle. I have real riding boots when I'm out there getting aggressive, but for casual riding on the back roads I bought these primarily for comfort when standing on the bikes pegs. These have the steel anti-puncture shank which work for that. Not only do I ride in these but these are MY EVERYDAY, ALL DAY &#34;shoes&#34;. These are all I wear. I'm a boot type of guy and never wear sneaker/gym shoes.These are most definitely comfortable as advertised (anti-fatigue). Smooth with every step. Rugged when hiking, working in the shop, and camping. THE ONE THING that would make these the best is insulation. Most everyday boots I buy have insulation (even in the summer I wear insulated boots), but these don't. Because I'm used to insulation my feet get a little cold in them but that's just meet. If these were insulated I'd probably hunt in them in the fall.Bottom line is I'll be buying these black waterproof ones again. Next time maybe in the 8 inch.
B002ASAKN2 Comfortable, no breaking in I've worn these for 4 business days so far. I'm in a manufacturing environment and my job requires that I'm from one end of the plant to the other all day long and I can honestly say that these boots honestly had no break in period. My heel was just a little blistered from a very small sliding on day 1, but on day 2 I tightened the lacing and the problem went away & has not came back. I generally wear an 11 1/2 in a boot but had to go up to a 12 on this boot so in my opinion, they run just a bit small, but who cares? take your size up by 1/2 and you've got a boot that's comfortable when you put them on the first time. I'm curious if I'll lose some lifespan due to the feel so far, but I'm hopeful that Timberline has the right mix of comfort and longevity.I'll never buy any boot with &#34;wing&#34; in the name again, really.
B002CVUSY8 Great boot! I've just recently bought a pair of Timberland fisherman's sandals and was impressed with their &#34;comfort system&#34; of foot support.I really like the sandals and now I've found this chelsea type boot and it has the same support system.  I've had these boots for about 2 weeks and I really like them.  I would surely recommend these boots.
B002NEGCC6 Flimsy, far too tight for the size you order Sorely disappointed.  &#34;Weak&#34; shoe for Timberland.  Couldn't wait to send them back.  Wish it wasn't such a waste of time
B002YOMJPY What can I say, it's a Timberland Great quality you expect from Timberland...although I didn't realize this boot comes up the ankle a little more than my Brown Timberland's #12135.  I guess that is what &#34;Mid&#34; means, I wish there was some side by side comparisons or a chart that distinguishes the difference to make that a little clearer.  I like them though, I just like the feel of my other Timberland's a little more.
B002YOMJPY DARN GOOD BOOTS!! I rarely write a review, am from a generation that believed either the product was good or it was returned. No need for gushing delights, nor bad mouthing. I write this because I have feet that are difficult to fit. 10.5 wide/2E. Often the length is fine, but the width is too narrow; or just the opposite. Even in the &#34;box stores&#34; hard to find a good fit. With Amazons' return policy I felt what the heck and ordered the Timberland boots.  After two months of wear I will put these boots against any of the same cost. The fit was instantly great, the sole-while slightly stiff- broke in quickly. The arch and toe box outstanding. Bottom line , should you buy this boot you have bought quality and fit. I have not been contacted by Amazon, Timberland, nor have any connection; other than a paying customer.
B002YOMJPY Great fit and comfort for my neuropathy I have had a terrible time over the last 5 or 6 years finding &#34;shoes&#34; that had room in them for my feet and my orthotics, that had enough sole cushioning to walk comfortably and keep my feet from freezing due to heat loss through the soles, these are the best I have found for all those needs. I went out Saturday, in near freezing weather, and walked 2.4 miles in them in comfort.  Previously, I haven't been able to walk to my mail box.I've ordered a second pair.
B002YOMJPY All purpose shoe More than a &#34;sneaker&#34;, but not quite a boot.  Perfect complement for everyday wear.  I bought these specifically to ride my &#34;sportbike&#34; and they fit the bill nicely!
B002YOMJPY Comfortable hikers I just received this pair of boots, but so far so good. I have a hard time finding shoes / boots that fit right. My feet are too wide for most &#34;normal&#34; width shoes and too narrow for 2Es. These fit well and wear like sneakers. I really like them. I'll update as they age.
B002YOMJPY Great Investment I purchased these boots six months ago. I intentionally waited to write a review because I see many people posting reviews the same day they receive their order. Now that I've worn these in, they fit great. I'm a size 14 and was concerned about buying shoes/boots online, but it worked out. There was an initial &#34;break-in&#34; period where the boots felt a bit stiff and rubbed my pinkie toe, but this should be expected. The styling is good and the boot looks exactly like the pictures, are easy to clean, and will not disappoint. Make sure to read the negative reviews to see why others didn't like these boots. I bought these to keep the winter rain from reaching my feet and they have done just that.
B002YOMJPY Excellent product and service The description and size as expected and better, Big &#34;Bravo&#34; to Amazon and Timberland products.Very disappointed from my previous purchase from &#34;Rockport&#34; shoes as the size was almost two sizes bigger then what they described as 10.5 US size!I have no use to my purchase as the shoes are too big and it too costly to return for replacementMany thanks for all my other successful purchasesOuri
B002YOMJPY Excellent Boot I live in downtown &#34;Rain City&#34; a.k.a. Seattle and this boot is just the thing for the urban hiker like me! My feet are always warm and dry. Five star rating.
B002YOMJPY Comfy-lands This is my 2nd pair :) These shoes are very comfortable and totally waterproof!! No &#34;break in&#34; period!!! They are great right out of the box!!
B0034G54BM Fun boots! The knee goes above the knee (I'm 5'7&#34;), my legs are body-height appropriate to long. They look great; I wear them mostly with short skirts and tall socks or tights.They are comfortable, considering they aren't sneakers or hiking shoes.(I consider those very comfy).
B0034G54BM Good &#34;Fall Boot&#34; I purchsed these boots mostly because of the price as I know the Timberland brand well and thought this was a great deal. I was not wrong! I have had only  one chance to wear them as they are a &#34;Fall Boot&#34; . I wore them shopping for a full day and found them  very comfortable. They kept my feet warm and dry. I was slightly dissapointed with the width of the leg, I was hoping for more of a snug fit and these are a little &#34;slouchy&#34;,  but I do have very thin legs so I am accustom a loose fit! Overall I am very happy with them.
B0034G54BM ABSOLUTELY LOVE These Boots!!! ok - so I'm tall, but I'm also a little &#34;fluffy&#34; - so I wondered if I sould get a Wide, but I didn't & I'm Grateful - these are Good Leather Boots, and although they were a little snug at first, they will stretch out a little after time, and once broken in - they will be Perfect!!  I can tell I'll have these boots for a Loooong Time!!  AND - the Shipping was Super Speedy - I had them in like 3 or 4 days.  Extremly Happy with my purchase!!  Thanks Tons!!
B0034G54BM Nice boot, but I can't keep it. The boot is well made and stylish but ended up not being quite what I was looking for because it is a little more &#34;motorcycle&#34; boot than riding boot.  It does run large.  I take a 6 or 6 1/2 depending on the shoe, and this 6 1/2 was pretty large for me.  I might have tried to make do by inserting an insole if the style had been what I was looking for but decided to return them.  I should also note that the toe area is pretty stiff and I don't think it will &#34;give&#34; much if you end up with a pair that are little on the tight side.  Still giving them 4 stars though for the quality.
B0034G54BM Save your money What a disappointment!  The &#34;suede&#34; looked like plastic.  I guess they would be fine for trekking in the outdoors, but for dress they're not.  I sent them back.
B0034G54BM Cute boots I wear an 8 1/2 in regular shoes and a 9 in running shoes. These fit as expected. I got a &#34;I love those boots&#34; comment on my second wear! They are a little more of a biker look than I had thought but still very cute.
B0034G54BM Disappointed Love the look and the material but the calf portion was just too small.  Big at the ankles compared to the calf.  I had a pair that had a 14&#34; circumference that fit and these were 15&#34; and didn't.  Hmmm.....
B0034G54BM excellent riding boot It's my first pair of Timberland shoes. Love it! Comfortable right from the box. Great with Jeans. I got a &#34;wide&#34; one because I have strong calves. But I think the regular one should be fine.
B0034G54BM Glad That I Read Reviews!! I ordered these Timberland Women's 20668 Earthkeepers Bethel Knee-High Boots in black twice. The first time I ordered them in 8.5M which is my normal size. When they arrived, I tried them on with my favorite &#34;boot socks&#34; (similar to sweat socks) and I had to squeeze my feet in these boots to get them on; I had zero wiggle room at all!!  I was so disappointed but I refused to give up. I recalled reading one review that advised shoppers to order your true size but make sure to order them in WIDE if you planned to wear a thicker sock with these boots.I am from the north east and I do wear these boots with a thicker sock as our winters can be brutal here. For my second order I returned the first pair and I took the reviewers advise, I ordered an 8.5W. I still had to &#34;break these in&#34; though and the soles offers zero cushion, so I'm a little disappointed in Timberland for that. These boots look great on but they were not constructed for comfort. I haven't developed any corns or bunions but I wouldn't advise doing tons of walking in them. I am happy with my purchase and the fact that Amazon offered these on sale with free shipping and free returns justifies my pleasure with this purchase!!
B0034G54BM Rather narrow for my calves ( Boots are great! Stylish, soft. Fit in tight jeans and a dress. But ... My calves 15 &#34;... I took a special W, and everything is perfect in the foot! ... But the above... is missing only 1&#34;! I will use the spray for stretching ... I think everything will be okay)))
B0034G54BM Very attractive .... Ok, I'll admit, I have an excessive boot collection but in the process, I have done extensive research and know the complex requirements of my feet and boots.  There are many specifics that I look for and one being the option for &#34;wide&#34; in the width of the foot bed.  I did order a wide in these but really had a different idea of what wide means compared to what these provide.  That aside, I love the style, construction, and fit of the boot in other areas and plan on keeping them and having them stretched.  I've looked for something similar that provides the &#34;skinny calf&#34; option to no avail.  These adjust at the top of the calf to fit a quite small calf to a larger one ... the suede does bunch some on the tighter knotch but I feel like it is not a deterent from this style of boot.
B0034G54BM Flat riding boot I like these boots but I have them in sage which I LOVE.  The black is fine, but they are monochromatic and look a little bit like &#34;biker boots&#34;.  Overall, a nice boot, easy to waterproof.
B0034G54BM GREAT BOOTS My favorite pair of boots are the Timberland Bethel dark brown new buck boots.  So naturally, I wanted to add to my closet by buying a black pair.  I was disappointed when I couldn't find them anywhere.  So ...I &#34;settled&#34; for the Earthkeepers.  My disappointment turned into pure delight.  The brown one are still my faves but these are definitely next in line.  I continue to be a Timberland fan
B0034G54BM Best purchase ever When I first received these boots I thought they may be a little tight.  Since I got a great deal on them and they are genuine leather I decided I would keep them and see how they stretched out. The first day I wore them they stretched a bit and by day 3 three they fit perfect! They are now my &#34;go to&#34; boots for comfort and style.  I love these boots. I can wear them a full 12 hours with no complaints!
B0034G54BM EDGY, YET BEAUTIFUL BOOT; RUNS TRUE TO SIZE I am a true size 38 EURO/7.5B(M) US, but I purchased these in size 7B(M).  They fit me like a glove with thin socks and can be stretched manually and/or with regular use.  Ordering my true size 7.5B(M) may have been a better choice if I wanted to wear thicker socks, but since I live in L.A. it's not really a necessity.  I believe these are true-to-size, so make your selection for purchase accordingly.The &#34;Bethel&#34; boot has a very versatile design for use with casual outfits (and *might be* passable as West-Coast &#34;dressy&#34;...for certain occasions/outfits).  The combination of leather and nubuck gives the boot a unique and tactile look and feel.  The top of the shaft hits about an inch below my knee (I'm 5'6&#34;).  Though I have 12.5&#34;-13&#34; circumference calves, the gap that I usually experience with U.S.-sized boots was not awkwardly huge.  This boot is tough, yet gorgeous.  In short, if these have been an item on your Wish List, don't wait for someone else to gift them - buy them as a gift to yourself.By the way, the philosophy behind the Earthkeeper line is fantastic.  Timberland has taken into consideration the impact their products have on the environment, without compromising style and quality.  There are other brands that share the same eco-consciousness in design, materials, manufacturing and packaging; hopefully, more companies will adopt this practice sooner than later.  I make purchasing decisions based on how and where products are manufactured.  That being said, this is my second pair of Timberland Earthkeeper boots, and will certainly not be my last.
B0034G558E Even nicer than expected I love this boot.  It's well-made, comfortable, and a bit more elegantly styled than similar boots.  The only thing I'm not thrilled about is that the suede tongue under the laces is very soft and you have to hold it in place while zipping the boot to prevent &#34;bunching.&#34;  Otherwise, couldn't be happier.
B0034G558E Comfortable and true to size if not a little big I don't know why some reviews on here say to go up a size in Timberlands. It's always been my experience that I need to go down a half size. I wear a 7.5 to an 8 normally, got these in a 7.5. Right out of the box they were comfortable, and after two days of wear felt like nicely broken in boots that I've had for ages. I've gotten tons of compliments with the most common being that my boots are &#34;bad a**&#34;. Might just buy another pair for work!
B0034G558E Great boots These boots arrived today and are exactly what I expected them to be. They feel nice quality & comfortable, but I have to exchange for a half size down (though people said they were &#34;true to size&#34;) Great utility style boots without being clunky.
B0034G558E A bit disappointed... I will be honest. The boots in the picture look always better than in reality. Lol. They actually look exactly like in the picture, but i guess i expected the leather or the boots in general to be much softer. The size felt right, with one single &#34;but&#34; - left boot felt much larger in width and right boot felt much tighter in width. Was it because left boot has been tried on more times and the right one at all???? So it sort of feels that left foot is swimming and right foot is okay, since it will get better with wearing. I only hope left boot doesnt get even larger with wearing since it is already kind of large. So, not as pleased as i thought would be. Totally expected much softer leather boots!!!
B0034G558E Awesome boots I have wide-ish feet but usually have success with an 8 M - these fit exactly as an 8 should. Extremely comfortable, leather is thick and firm but with enough &#34;give&#34; that they begin to mold to your feet almost immediately.  Easy to wear, comfortable, and they go with everything.
B0034G558E Sexy boots anyone? I am a fan of Timberland products and this is just another gem to add to my collection.I love how versitile it is with skirts, dresses, jeans, leggings! The possibilities are endless.They are comfortable and I didn't experience any &#34;breaking in&#34; period like I usually do as the skin on my feet is incredibly soft from mostly wearing runners.These are a fav! I HIGHLY recommend them and have them in two colours! :)
B0034G558E The New &#34;Go To&#34; Boots Love, love, LOVE these boots.  As other reviewers have said, they are comfortable out of the box.  I have another pair of Timberland boots and realized before purchasing these that they run narrow.  It was nice to see these in a wide option (although not available in my size), so I ordered a half size up.  While they're a little big, the width is perfect.  As for those who have complained that the tongue isn't made of stiff leather, who cares?  It takes no more than a couple of seconds to hold it up and adjust when putting on the boot.  These are definitely my new &#34;go to&#34; boots.  If they come back around on sale and in my size I will definitely be purchasing more colors.
B0034G558E Ehh... I sent them back.  LOVE Timberland & this boot wasn't bad but it wasn't &#34;me&#34;.  I was hoping for a little more edgy & less...maybe...Little House on The Prairie-looking boot.  I wanted more combat but not to the point that I look like I could really go to war.  It's just an opinion & maybe if I'd kept them one more day & looked at them with a fresh outlook I'd have kept them but when my BF said &#34;Yeah, they're okay. I think you should keep them.&#34; I immediately thought &#34;I don't want OKAY, I want cool, bada*s, hot, sexy, tough, etc&#34;.  Sorry for the overuse of quotes.
B0034G558E Exactly what I wanted These boots are perfect.The color is well-represented, at least on my monitor. The fit is spot-on; I wear a size 9 normally and the size 9 in this boot fits perfectly.  I will mention I have fairly narrow feet.  There is not much support in the shoe, so an insert would be a good idea.  The quality of the manufacture is SUPERB. The boots are extremely well-made with quality materials.The shoes are attractive and has the &#34;look&#34; I wanted. Rugged, but feminine. I wear the boots primarily with skirts and I get tons of compliments on them. They are comfortable enough to wear all day, but again, I would recommend a cushion/support insert if you're going to be doing a lot of walking.I will definitely be buying another pair once I wear these out!
B0034G558E Comfy It's comfortable and sturdy like all the other Timberland boots that I've tried and similarly runs a bit small in the toe box.  The laces are functional and make it nicely adjustable for different calf sizes.  In person, I don't like how the buckle looks on the black version.  I'm not sure what it is, but it looks &#34;off/tacky/fake&#34; or something with this otherwise nice boot.  The lining is also smoother and nicer in the similar Savin Hill Mid Lace Boot, which I bought instead.
B0034G558E It's Timberland. What more can I say? They make a great product. I believe it's been over a year since I've ordered these for my daughter. She has a fallen arch, so her foot is wide. I just wore them for the first time recently and they still look great. We probably just need to replace the insoles. While other boots have &#34;bit the dust&#34; these are still going strong.
B0034G5I5Y Best walking/hiking shoe ever This is my 3rd pair of this shoe. The comfort and quality are amazing. Whether I am on vacation in a city where I am walking all day or hiking in Nepal, this is the shoe I wear. They provide excellent support and are not to heavy. Also there is no &#34;breaking in&#34; time. Just put them on and go. Also they last forever. I bought this pair because my current pair have had several trips to Nepal with very heaving hiking so getting a little worn looking; however, they are still great. I am using this new pair for &#34;city&#34; walking on holidays.
B0034G5KAC Not for the slim calf as my search indicated Purchased specifically because the calf was advertised as slim...approx 14.5&#34;...not so much. They were about 2 inches too wider in the &#34;slim calf opening.&#34; Comfy sole but not the right fit. I have chicken legs so the search continues.
B0034G5KAC Use the sizing info chart! I read a lot of reviews before I purchased these boots and many of them stated that the boots were too small. I used the &#34;Sizing Info&#34; chart (located next to the &#34;Select Size&#34; drop down) and I ended up having to get out a measuring tape and measure my foot from heel to toe. The sizing chart told me to order a size 9, which is one size larger than I usually buy my boots. I was a little apprehensive about it, but when I got the boots in the mail, I tried them on and they fit very well! I even tried them on with jeans and the thickest pair of socks I own, and they still fit well. (I will admit that I have sort of twiggy legs, so if you have a nice calf muscle, you may want to take that into account.) My advice is to definitely check the &#34;Sizing Info&#34; chart and measure your foot according to what it says. I am very happy with my boots and I can't wait to wear them once the weather cools down a little more.
B0034XS4OY Good compromise for "business casual" I use these shoes for my &#34;business casual&#34; days at work (mostly Fridays).  I also use them when traveling for work, so that I don't need to bring two pairs of shoes (1 for work, and 1 for the plane).
B003A4V78C Good Quality I was very excited to receive my new pair of shoes Men's Timberland PRO Five Star Ashford Oxford, the first impression is &#34;sensational&#34;, to wear it, is exactly what I expected or even more.Excellent quality and feels and looks very comfortable.Highly recommended for those who work long time or walk a lot.
B003A4V78C Not worth the money and not very nice on my feet. Unfortunately, they got dirty on the first night I wore them and I've gone ahead and worn them twice since...otherwise, I would have returned them.  They are NOT very comfortable/&#34;soft&#34; on the bottoms of my feet.  Major hotspots build on the heel during my shifts...real downer.  This is not an issue I had in my restaurant Crocs.
B003A67X5G okay but not a work boot I put a thin insole pad in this boot and it seems much more comfortable to take up the slightly larger sizing. I did not want to take a chance on getting something too small.The leather is very soft and very easy to take on and off.I think this would be good for someone on their feet a lot but I would not call the construction a &#34;work boot&#34;.I bought something similar for close to the same money by a company called Georgia named the Romeo. It is shorter in height and needs to be stretched a lot to get on and off but it constructed with a strong welt and has a better lining.The Timberland is good but not great in my opinion.
B003A67X5G Really good! Had them a couple of weeks now! It really works in terms of working in a really busy restaurant and having to have some real traction when walking in and out from slippery floors during service! Im gonna be honest, dont expect to be &#34;screwed on the floor&#34; but it really is a lot more stable compared to my previous shoes! Water proof is really good also, as well as the sole and its &#34;anti-fatigue system&#34;! The only problem is that the shoes hasn't really adopt to the for m of my feet completely but i expect it to happen soon! Very satisfied with all the rest though!
B003A69RS2 Comfortable These shoes are comfortable, walking and standing.  However, I still miss the &#34;precise fit&#34; model that they discontinued.  I particularly like the soft surrounding around the ankles in the old model.  The new one has leather all around the ankle and it feels hard after walking for a while.
B003A6I6NO Don't let the pro line fool you, great looking shoes with extra features. Shoes fits as expected. Soles are truly non slip and very comfortable. You would never look at these as &#34;pro&#34; and they just look like nice black leather slip ons. Great for business casual or jeans and a shirt. If they made them in brown I would get those too.
B003A6J1NS good boot I am a union carpenter in Northern Minnesota and I mostly do concrete forming.  I have owned these boots for close to one year and I am happy with their overall performance.  They have held up well.  My only gripe is the left boot's inner lining has come unglued or unstitched so when my foot is sweaty I need to shove a long shoe horn into the boot to hold the lining down otherwise I cannot remove my foot.  There is ample room in the toe and my &#34;hammer toes&#34; which typically rub on traditional steel toed work boots have never once rubbed on these.
B003ELOYEA Feet froze in 34 degree weather! Bought these boots after reading all the great reviews for how warm they are. I live in Minnesota and wore these to Bock Fest. I was outside in 34 degree weather, with no wind or snow on the ground and my feet were freezing I couldn't feel my toes!!! Disappointed buyer.
B003EV5QDS Awesome Boot Looks great.  Leather is less &#34;red&#34; than appears on most of these pictures.  Definitely a gray and black boot as advertised.
B003LVYYQQ wrong size Ordered 34 w 38 l and they gave me 38w and 34 l. I see they did this to some one else on another review.
B003NUQWFG Thermal force 8&#34; review I own 2 older pair that I purchased 2 years ago. They are the best and most comfortable boots i have owned to date. I wear a size 15 2E so finding boots is always a challenge. The new boots are a little different. They are lighter in weight. My old ones are steel toe. The new ones say safety toe. Not sure if it's steel or not. Also new ones have thinsulate &#34;zones&#34; where my old ones had thinsulate throughout. Overall they are still very comfortable. I have not worm them in any bad weather but expect them to perform as well as my old ones. I heard from a distributor that timberland is coming out with a replacement of the thermal force but I don't remember the model name. I hope they make it waterproof and insulated like these. I really like them
B003NUQWY2 Great for larger foot size! These boots looked perfect for winter hiking and came in size 15 which is so often hard to find. Upon arrival, ( which was exceptionally fast), the fit was perfect with a bit extra for thick socks which I hadn't thought would be possible as at 6ft. 8 in., I was sure they'd fit snug.Love the fit, the color, casual style, and the leather. It's the soles that are cheap and will wear out sooner than they look. But rest assured, the heel top won't &#34;shred&#34; as the leather strap around the heel really is good in preventing the boot tops from cracking!
B003NUQWY2 Great boot I tried many pairs of boots before settling on these. Very comfortable, very rugged, warm, and they look good. I do think they run a touch big though. I'm usually a 10.5&#34; in everything, and the 10.5&#34; felt huge. I went with the 10 and with them broken in, they are perfect.
B003TFEA5O Too small right out of the box Buyer beware - made in C-HINA.  There are Justin and other bootmaker products for under $200 made in USA.These boots were purchased at the same time I purchased a pair of Justin boots elsewhere, both purportedly size 5.5B.  Ordinarily I wear a size 5 (women), so I &#34;sized up&#34; to allow for variations in manufacture and sock size used (I like a slightly thicker sock to prevent blistering when riding horses, walking long distance or working outside).  Right out of the box, I could see there was a problem - these boots were a full ONE INCH shorter than the Justin boot!!  Even zipped all the way down, I could barely squeeze my left foot in (the larger of my feet) without socks on.  When I attempted to zip the boot up, it began pinching my calf 2/3 of the way up my leg.  My calf measures 14&#34; around at the thickest part, and barely 14.2 at the top, just below the knee (I am short, almost 5'2&#34;).  The specs on these boots said they were 14.25&#34; at the top - not even close - more like 13.75&#34;, if that.  IF one wants to tuck trousers or jeans into these boots, forget it unless you have &#34;twiggy&#34; legs.  For the brief moment my foot was in the left boot, it was just too tight - instep too low (for my high arch), pressing on my foot.  With great disappointment and no intention of ordering a larger size, I boxed them right up and took them down to UPS for return.Other aspects - workmanship looked good on perfunctory inspection - leather dyed nicely, evenly.  Out of the box the boots looked wonderful and I was VERY excited to try them on.  Stitching seemed solid around zippers, no overpowering chemical odor.  Very nice looking boots, which is why I gave them a 2 star and not a 1 star.  If they had fit me, they would probably have gotten a 4 star, to be raised to 5 after wearing them happily for a couple of months.  So sad.  I love boots like some guys love cars or football.  Really bummed one cannot seem to find decently priced well made boots anymore and hoping my Justins work out better.
B003TFEA5O Like a glove!!! I've wanted these boots for like two years! I have always bought &#34;cheap&#34; boots so these were a bit of an investment/commitment.  The &#34;cheap&#34; boots are uncomfortable and fall apart after a couple of months.  So I finally bit the bullet and bought my dream boots.  Couldn't be happier with my decision. These are very well-made; nice leather, good arch support, awesome grip on slippery surfaces. Got my regular size and they fit perfect.  I did opt for the wider size so I can wear thick socks in winter. Probably gonna rock these all year.  Only the test of time will tell how they hold up but I think this is the beginning of a very beautiful long-term relationship.
B003TFEA5O Sexy AND functional? Yes please! I've owned a pair of lace-up suede Timberland boots for 2 years, and living in Wisconsin means I get to wear them a LOT, so I have a lot of confidence in the brand's quality. What drew me in to this pair was the chestnut color. I was a little concerned about fit because these only zip up and I have 15&#34; calves. I have read reviews of ladies with wider calves where these boots work, and sometimes they do not. I would say take a chance, because you never know until you try.Depending on shoe style & brand, I'm typically an 8 1/2 or a 9. I don't have wide feet but I have shorter toes that like their wiggle room. I ordered a 9 medium and an 8 1/2&#34; wide (for a wider toe box).The results:The 8 1/2 would have worked if I were only going to wear these with bare legs/pantyhose. The leather band at the top was very snug, but I think it would have stretched another 1/8&#34;+ over time. However, living in Wisconsin, boots usually need heavy leggings/skinny jeans to go with them. When I tried these on with skinny jeans, I could still get them on but the term &#34;sausage casing&#34; came quickly to mind. The adjustable buckle at the top made no difference, as that hit my calf at the slimmer area. The problem was a couple inches down, at the base of the leather band.I tried on the 9, and lo and behold -- MAGIC! They were a little roomier in the heel but a pair of cushy running socks fixed that quickly. I wore them with skinny jeans all day at work yesterday because they were SO comfortable and sexy! Woo hoo! My new favorite fall boots! I particularly like the heel, which allows these riding boots to be worn for actual riding purposes. The quality is definitely rugged enough to wear these in the stable. Speaking of rugged, the suede of the calf area is not buttery soft like on my Coach purses, but who cares when they're busy running around town or cantering across a meadow in their boots? Not me.For what it's worth, I'm 5'2&#34; and these boots come to just below my knees. I'm a very active person, and when I bend my legs they don't bother me at all.
B003TFEA5O Not for small calves 7.5 is 15&#34; even though it says &#34;&#8226;Boot opening measures approximately 14&#34; around&#34;. Also the boot is flimsy. It does not stay up at all. I wills end it back.
B003TFEA5O Instantly one of my wife's favorites Got these as a &#34;get out of the doghouse&#34; present for my wife.  She loved them so much she slept with them on my pillow while I slept on the sofa!  Damn you Timberland, why do you have to make such good boots!!!???  They look and feel great.  At least according to her.  Seriously, I'm not wearing women's boots.  These are for my wife.
B003TFEA5O THE PERFECT BOOT!!! I fell in love with these boots the minute I saw them online!!  They arrived within days after I ordered them.  The fit is pretty good, just a wee bit snug with thick socks, until they get &#34;broken in&#34; I'll be wearing trouser socks w/them :)  The color works great with khakis.
B003TFEA5O I love these boots! Cushion, comfort, style - I can't wait for the weather to cool off so I can wear them!  They look even better &#34;in person!!&#34;
B003TFEA5O Seconds? I have ordered and returned these boots four times; twice to Amazon, once to Timberland, and once to anothershoe site. There was something wrong with every pair of boots: spots, discolorations, one buckle a different colorfrom the other and obvious touch-ups to spots. I really like these boots and obviously wanted them, since I tried somany times to buy them. I'm wondering if the defects have anything to do with being made in China, and I am alsothinking Amazon must get &#34;seconds&#34;. I would love it if some company would send me a pair without imperfections.
B003TFEA5O Not for wide calves I ordered these in a wide because I have a 16&#34; calf and I couldn't zip these up. Not only that, but putting on this shoe was a challenge and they were supper uncomfortable on the top of my foot. (my foot is not wide, just my calf) They look super cute in the box but they're going back. I measured my &#34;wide&#34; shoes I ordered and they are infact 15&#34;.
B003UFJCP6 Super Comfortable! I don't wear these for lounging, but I can see why they're called a &#34;lounger boot.&#34;  They are SUPER comfortable, even after wearing them all day.  Virtually no break-in time, and very cute with jeans.  This boot doesn't offer a huge amount of support (guess that's why they're for &#34;lounging&#34;), so I wouldn't recommend them if you're doing a lot of steady walking or hiking.  I did more walking than usual one day, and I could feel the lack of support in the arch area.  But, for running errands and just basic everyday wear, these are wonderful!  When I ordered these, I saw that some reviewers said they ran large, so I ordered the small end of my size range (5-6), and they fit perfectly, with plenty of wiggle room in the toe.  And that's with wearing a medium-heavy weight sport sock.  I may have to get another pair of these....
B003UFJCP6 Cute as a Button These boots were hard to find as they came out a while ago. My daughter saw them on her colleg campus and had to have them. Leave it to good ole amazon to come to the rescue. I found her size and the rest is &#34;her&#34;story!
B003UFJCP6 Really neat shoes. I own a pair of timberland work boots that I wore during construction, but now that I'm a student, it was time to up my footwear.  These are...different than the boots.  They are a lot lighter and feel more like tennis shoes than anything else.  The insole is not very soft, but has a high arch (which is great, because my arches are crazy-high and it's difficult to find support).  I'm looking forward to wearing these out.  They look narrower than they are, and I have plenty of foot room for any type of sock and for additional support if I chose to put in gel inserts.  Some people had problems not getting the &#34;patent leather&#34; on theirs...mine came exactly as they looked, so I was extremely happy.Shipping was a day early!  I ordered these on a thursday night and got them monday morning; wasn't expecting them until Tuesday!I'm giving them a 4/5 just because they aren't as comfortable as my boots, but everything else is spectacular.  The fit is perfect, the color is perfect, and I love the style.  Definitely recommend these for comfortable, but snazzy &#34;out on the town&#34; shoes if you feel like leaving your heels at home :)
B003UFJCP6 Disappointed Not happy with quality of boot.  The photo made the boot seem much &#34;beefier&#34;.  I was disappointed in the thin sole and lack of support.
B003XHH0W8 Loved them I ordered (and returned) several other pairs of boots before these, but these are great. Good fit, they look nice, and while not rated as &#34;waterproof&#34; they have shown good water resistance in wet conditions. Casual enough for the weekend but I also wear them to work in winter. Obviously, these were the ones I kept. I have wide feet, so I especially appreciated that they had a WIDE size in stocks -- many brands don't.
B003XHH0W8 Timberland Mt Washington Chelsea boot Great boot and unlike my Timberland Earthkeepers they are waterproof! Good support, comfy, look great. Can't say enough good things, hope they keep making them and they become a &#34;classic&#34;.
B003XHH0W8 Serious design flaw-- Buyer Beware These are attractive and well-fitting boots made of quality materials. Why am I returning them in mild disgust? Because the squishy insole is so deep that the actual rubber sole underneath it is maybe 1/4 inch thick. or less. This results in a very thin sole of super-soft rubber that you could stick a dull pencil through without much effort. If I kept these boots, the sole would have a hole worn in within 3 months of everyday walking, or less if I happened to step on anything that punctured the made-to-fail sole (like a sharp stone, for example).  So, chalk this one up to deliberate corporate deceitfulness, and take a pass. If &#34;deceitfulness&#34; seems like a strong word, consider that Timberland markets these as &#34;green&#34; boots, even though they are designed to need to be replaced in a fraction of the time that decent boots should last (creating more pollution etc). Sheesh.
B003XHH0W8 good fit good firm fit, casual feeling, but dressy look to them.  Comfortable enough to wear ALL DAY LONG with no complaints.  Got these in both black and brown.  The brown ones I had an issue where the loop on the back ripped so pulling them on was a little different... but Amazon overnighted me new ones so no issues there.  I have another pair that I wore for a year... they still fit and function fine, the oiled look is just different now, I wore them out in the snow and I guess the salt and snow effect on them wasn't that kind to them.  They still look great, they have the &#34;distressed&#34; brown leather look, which I actually like so it worked out, I just wanted a cleaner looking pair to wear to work.
B0040UDP6C What a DISASTER! I was so excited when I ordered these shoes. But apparently FedEx could not find my house.Which is BS because I order things on Amazon all the time--in fact I order things on Amazon too much.I always use the same address, as it is saved on my account.Never had I ever had this problem. Seriously, how stupid do you have to be to miss an entire house?However, &#34;The Scarpetta&#34; provided good customer service--or so I thought.FedEx shipped the package back to the seller. I politely asked &#34;The Scarpetta&#34; to send the shoes using UPS or a different carrier since FedEx is the ONLY ONE that has EVER caused problems for me.I wouldn't have cared that much if they told me they couldn't ship the shoes using a different carrier, and shipped them using FedEx. BUT they said that they WOULD SHIP THE SHOES using a DIFFERENT CARRIER. But they didn't. They sent the shoes using FedEx. Again. Even though they said they wouldn't. Which was super annoying, but at this point I didn't care. I just wanted my damn shoes.But apparently, after &#34;The Scarpetta&#34; shipped the shoes again, it got lost in the mail.Either I have really bad luck, or FedEx workers are idiots. How can you f*** something up so much?They gave me a full refund, but I wasn't happy.They weather is terrible here and I needed these shoes for the harsh snow.I ordered the shoes again after the refund, but from a different seller this time. I ordered the &#34;Timberland Donna''sfrom &#34;ShoeMetro.&#34; And I paid for Expedite Shipping (1-3 days). It has been three days, and the shoes are not here.In fact, the estimated delivery date is 2/25/14, an ENTIRE WEEK after the order date.This seriously has been the worse experience I've had buying ANYTHING online.Oh and they're shipping the shoes using FedEx, again.I pray that they will get here soon, undamaged.
B00440CVPY Beware the picture! These really are &#34;low rider&#34; socks - not as shown in the photo (which are crew). Buyer beware! Nothing wrong with the socks - they just don't match the photo.
B00440CVWC Knocked off a star just because these do not contain "organic" cotton. These socks fit great, and they LOOK great too.  I have to walk around client houses a lot and so I wanted something that was more then just plain black or white, and these fit the bill perfectly.  I also love that these come in two different colors.  I did take off one star just because 1) they do not appear to have any &#34;organic&#34; cotton in them, and 2) there are actually 2 different material ratios, each color is different, where the product description showed only one.  I've posted a picture of the label.  Outside of that... very happy.
B0049N3S58 Comfy for a long day on feet These shoes look kind of big, but they fit very well.  Wore them out of the box for a 13 hour day at work and feet were still in good shape and did not hurt.  Looking forward to see how well they hold up in &#34;weather&#34;.  The slip resistance seems good as I did not feel any slippage on diesel fuel on the ground.  I do wish they had a pull tab on the heel to help pull the shoes on and the laces need to be a little longer.  But, if that is all I can find wrong, then I have a good purchase here.
B004EWG3IS Best Socks Ever I used to buy the cheap &#34;dollar&#34; socks.  No more.  Pay a little bit more.  These are more than worth it.
B004EWG3QA "The BEST" These are the &#34;BEST&#34; sox for sports that I have owned. I have previously owned 6 pairs of the same sox and they have lasted for over a year.  Fit is perfect, comfortable, long lasting and quality material. I would highly recommend these sox.
B004FESCK2 Waiting for winter... So far, I really love this boot.  I bought it for a deep discount in April, so I haven't warn it in the snow or sleet yet.  Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the fit, style and make.  Its quite comfortable and light.  Although the name includes &#34;knee high&#34; it is not knee-high.  Its a mid-calf level boot, but very stylish. I am also happy about the sole of the boot, it looks like it will be nice and sturdy on rain-covered ice.  I had a hard time choosing between an 8 1/2 and a 9 since I vary depending on the brand (and I have never owned Timberlands before).  I chose the 9 and it fits very well, especially with wool socks.
B004J2HSLY Bought these based on reviews here on Amazon I got these for the spouse to wear as a light work shoe.  The reviews assured me that he would love 'em.  He does!!  And he's got &#34;fussy feet&#34;.  Plantar fasciitis flare-ups, bad bunion.  He put these on and said, &#34;Ahhhhhh...relief!&#34;.  Now these are his favorite shoes. Size fit was accurate.  Good going, Timberland!
B004J2HSLY Timberland Timberland is a great brand, very comfort, with a solid design for very fair price.Im a &#34;timberland walker&#34; for a long time.
B004JZPRWS Hubby says he has to check to make sure he isn't wearing his slippers! Bought these for my husband as work shoes. He is on his feet all day. He told me that when he leaves to go to work, he always has to double-check to make sure he didn't leave his slippers on, because these shoes are THAT comfy. They have a nice cushioned feel to them. This &#34;cushion&#34; is like a waffle type pattern and wicks away moisture, leaving feet dry and odor free!Heavy duty construction. True to size. I haven't found anything I haven't liked about these shoes. I highly recommend these to anyone, especially if you have to be on your feet a lot. They are perfect for jeans, khakis - business casual stuff.Hope this review has been helpful. :)
B004K22QM4 durable and stylish These boots are comfortable, warm for the winter and very durable. True to size.  They looks great loosly tighted up with fitted jeans cuffed. The working mans &#34;hipster&#34; boot.
B004K66PAE Boots are really nice, but too small I have a wide foot, and although I ordered the wide width, they were still a little snug. The boots themselves are made well, the leather has a &#34;pebbled&#34; appearance&#34; and a stacked heel. Overall, a nice boot, just fit a little more snug that I thought they would
B004K66PAE awesome boots I wanted these to fit a little big so I ordered a half size bigger than I usually wear. I love the finish, height, and they are pretty comfortable too. Great boot! And even less expensive than the local &#34;outlet&#34; where they have the same boot for a lot more.
B004LA3VYW Reliable and sturdy boots These boots are comfortable and are very light despite being labeled as &#34;rugged&#34;. The water resistance is not that great though, I think it is just a simple water proofing treatment that you can get done for any leather footwear. The water resistance on mine wore off after a trip to Niagara Falls where they got really wet on one of the rides. Other than that though they are quite durable.
B004P1Q84C Good quality, great style I have another pair of these same boots in the lighter color that I purchased 2 years ago, that have served me well and fit perfectly, but they were becoming worn out, so I bought the darker pair just last week. They are even more attractive than my first pair, and they fit like a glove once more. The style is cool without being &#34;LOOK AT ME!!&#34;, and I get compliments all the time. Great boots for the price. Just be careful: These boots run a bit large, and narrow. I had to go 1 size down, but with a wide width.
B004P3AJ7C Third pair Timberlands this style I love my new boots, i cannot really wear the &#34;standard&#34; timberland boots comfortably, and i ab-so-lutely LOVE these, thank you!!
B004PAPNYY Fine! It is just an &#34;every day&#34; glasses, my boyfriend looks amazing on itI hope materials resist my boyfriends hands
B004PPLZEG Fits well.  Looks sharp.  Stays warm. Stays Dry I had a pair of tims from about 10 years ago that had held up pretty well until now, so I stuck with them.  So far so good.  They are super comfortable, though I always go a half size up on Timberland.Not much more to say.  They do everything they say they will and cause no discomfort whatsoever.You know how you might have to &#34;unlace&#34; a pair of taller boots or high top sneaks to get your foot in?  The top two spots get laced through boot hooks and are not permanently fed through grommets or eylets so you can easily pull the tongue way out for putting them on if it is a tight fit.
B004Q01HZM Not what I expected. when I got these boots, the look of them reminded me much more of cowboy boots than the picture in the ad. Sizing and comfort was good and as expected.  all in all the construction and stitching seemed good but the leather was very thin and cheap, even for a &#34;looks&#34; boot.  I ended up getting red wing iron rangers instead and the difference in quality is astonishing, of course the red wings are more than twice as much, but they are worth it.
B004Q01HZM These Boots should be called Shoes I wasn't that happy with these &#34;Boots&#34;. although, I am wearing them.  They fit, feel and behave more like high top shoes.  I had to purchase Arch supports to make them feel more comfortable.  Do not wear thick socks, as they will cramp your feet.
B004RQ1JH6 great shoes. I find myself wearing them all day almost every day. They look like office shoes and I originally bought them to &#34;visit&#34; plants during my sales visits and be able to take them off in the car but they're so comfy I just wear them all day. I am going to order a pair in black soon.
B004RQ38B6 Sizes are somewhat larger than expected versus regular shoe sizes I ordered two sizes as I'd read they run a little large.  I typically wear a 14W in normal shoes but the Timberland 14's were a little loose.  The size 13W fit perfect with regular socks.  The shoes are &#34;lighter&#34; and have good cushion that makes them extremely comfortable to wear all day.  They are great shoes and I look forward to wearing them when I visit our manufacturing facilities.
B0052A6Z70 Works Boots I love these Timberland Pro Valor Boots, there awesome!!!! they There  just what i have been looking for...you can&#34;t beat the comfort, they are truly water proof, and in my line of work!! that&#34;s very important..I will be buying these boots for as long as im in the work force!!!
B0054HM47Q Well made but extremely uncomfortable These are incredibly uncomfortable, I don't understand how these can possibly be recommended for someone on their feet all day.  The heal seems to sit lower than the ball so you're forced to walk with your toes lifted for clearance, the padding on the ball of the foot is unnecessarily hard and the length of the shoe seems to be longer than a standard 8.5.  I'm in between sizes, but found this to be more of a size 9.  And although the size is longer, the width is not wider and sits too snug.  After walking for 20 to 30 minutes on a flat, paved road my feet are in too much pain to continue.  Despite this, I did try a few times, hoping they would &#34;break in&#34;, but the sole and position is just not right.  I appreciate the water resistance, they're likely made to last longer than the standard casual/athletic shoe you buy in the same price range (not mentioning names) but the fit FOR ME is far from acceptable and not what I expected from Timberland.
B00552O8Y2 Nonslip is Nice I play in a bandOften we have to bring equipment from outside in wet or snowy weather, to inside, many times to waxed and shiny floors.I was looking for a pair of shoes, that looked good, were comfortable, and were nonslip- these fit the bill.Although the &#34; finish &#34; is not a shiny as I would like, they are very comfortable, and the nonslip is amazing!The fact that I bought them on sale was the selling point for me.
B0056QW98E Mary Jane style too tight They were too tight across the &#34;t&#34; strap & narrow in the heel. I was expecting to feel wowed by this shoe so was very disappointed. I've ordered a different style in a wide width. It hasn't arrived.
B0056RMY2O Teacher Approved I am always looking for a good shoe to wear to work.  I came across this and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  These shoes are the best shoes I have ever found.  I will say they aren't &#34;cute&#34; but I don't think they are hideous either.  One of my kids at school asked me why I was wearing doctor shoes!  I liked them so much I got them in red too.  I will buy again.
B00590TE1W Perfect I bought these to use as my &#34;pedicure&#34; shoes - something to slip on after my pedis so I don't ruin thepolish.  They're perfect for that.  I just can't wear them for long - the style leaves bruises between by toes because I'm used to wearing a different style.  Very pretty though!
B00591MPAI Truly Feminine I bought these not only because of the style, but because they were earthkeepers. I previously purchased earthkeeper sandals that are extremely comfortable and trusted that these would be as well.Although I haven't externally debuted them to the world yet, I've tried them on and they feel great.Not to mention they got a &#34;Wow&#34; from my guy! :)They are sleek, sexy and truly feminine.  I can't wait to choose which outfit to where them with.
B005A5YQ2S Only one gripe and it's not anything to worry about! Great boot... works out awesome just like my other timbers and holds tight to it's duties... the only gripe I have is fashionably... the &#34;grey&#34; rubber part of the soles have blue specks on them... not noticable unless you are looking closely... other than that... these are wonderful hiking and mountain climbing boots... and I'm super satisfied as always with all the timbers I've owned.
B005APTZ4W Fine boots. They may not be &#34;any occasion&#34; boots. Normally Chelsea boots are a stylish fall / winter accessory. Those were made by Timberland, so they have sort of working / traveler spirit in them similar to Dr. Martens. They are however, comfy and very well made.
B005BWB2QI Amazing shoes This is my second pair of Timberland &#34;boat shoes&#34; or whatever. They are like Sperry's but better looking, more comfy, and more environmental. All pluses in my book. They last and they feel good. What more can you ask for?
B005BWB2QI As expected... Fit about half a size small as others have said.  My &#34;laces&#34; were too long, but that was easy enough to sole...
B005BWB2QI Unhappy with these After first putting them on, and being surprised by how loose they felt, I compared these shoes to another pair of thoroughly-broken-in Timberland boat shoes that I have owned for several years. Both are the same stated size, yet these were 1/2&#34; longer and 1/4&#34; wider. And they are brand new! Imagine after they were worn and got stretched out. But size was not my only gripe.I wore them around the house for about 10 minutes, and could not help but notice the poor cushioning of the soles. Regardless of whether I was on carpeting or hardwood, I felt like I was wearing slippers on concrete. So, I took them off to begin the return process, and realized that my feet had become sweaty. In an unlined shoe, in only a few minutes! Apparently this new &#34;Eco-conscious&#34; tanning process also acts as a sealing process. Not a very desirable feature in casual shoes. As so often is the case in shoes these days, quality is inversely proportional to hype.Oh.. and the &#34;Taupe&#34; color is quite dark. At a glance, you would see it as a darkish brown.
B005BWB2QI Very Nice I love these.  I would buy them again.  My wife has been on me to wear more &#34;adult&#34; shoes in the summer, rather than flip flops, and these are really comfortable and nice looking.
B005BWB2QI Timberland Earthkeepers Have been wearing boat shoes for over 30 years and Timbe3rland continues to be one of my &#34;Go to&#34; brands..comfortable and wear well.  Only thing I think all boat shoe manufacturers should do is go to a non leather lace as although the leather ones look nice they don't tie or adjust the shoe as well as other types...
B005BWB2QI Probably a great shoe, but Timberland will not allow it to be shipped to NH Probably a great shoe, but Timberland will not allow it to be shipped to NH.  I just spent 45 min in online chat with &#34;James&#34; and he said that the reason that it cannot be shipped to my location is because Timberland has a &#34;restriction&#34;.  That is a less than helpful answer.I suspect they are protecting some territories.  Their home office is less than 50 miles away.Come on Amazon, you have enough clout to make them change their policy!
B005BWB2QI cool Shoes is too large for my size, I want to get small size shoes. my friend said that &#34; this shoe is perfect&#34;
B005BWB2QI Good quality and accurate wide fit At last, a &#34;wide&#34; width shoe that is actually that.  I bought this with the Sebago double wide, and it is actually wider, and fits better.  I wish they had a 3 eyelet version.  Still, this is likely to become my &#34;go to&#34; boat shoe.
B005BWB2QI Kiawah Bay by way of China This shoe is very typical of the Chinese cardboard-like leather that has taken over the market.It's what is out there. Timberland had gone the way of America's shoe retailers.Fifty years ago a friend warned me of &#34;the yellow peril&#34;; it's on the way.
B005BWB6RS Comfortable, good fit, and durable. I got my Timberlands to replace some Sperry boat shoes that I was less than satisfied with. They're a major improvement. The fit was accurate. They're very comfortable, with great arch support. They have a durable and &#34;grippy&#34; sole. Great value.
B005ERZ6MQ Timberland shoes ain't what they used to be Not especially comfortable; fit is too tight; all man-made inner materials make my feet sweat.  What the hell has happened to Timberland shoes??  I've worn their &#34;oxfords&#34; similar to these for more than ten years; the last two versions were sub-par, and these are even worse.  Never again.
B005FI1VE6 Cute and look well-made but the strap cuts into my daughter's ankle and she doesn't like the feel of the &#34;bumps&#34; on the bottom of her foot.  She is usually not fussy about shoes and she won't wear them.  We will send them back-too uncomfortable.
B005FI1VE6 Oh so cute!! I bought these for my little one.  Of course, she has the type of foot that you never know what is going to fit unless you try them on!!  These were a tad bit long, but she will grow into them soon!!  She still wears them because they are purple and her favorite color!!!  She says, &#34;I luv them Mommy! They are so comfable!!&#34;  I love my 3-year-old.
B005FI1VE6 Great product Very light, nicely designed and fully adjustable sandals. Not slippery when wet, and allow one to be &#34;amphibian&#34; as necessary (ex. in a park with fountains or near a swimming pool). Definitely recommend.
B005FI1VE6 She loves em I bought these for my two year old daughter. she loves em. when she wants to go outside she can somewhat put them on byherselfevery other time we go out another parent ask where we got these from.&#34;thers just so cute&#34; they say
B005FI1VE6 Cute and Very Functional I got these for my five year old daughter. They are pretty enough that she &#34;consents&#34; to wearing them, although in her mind they would be better if covered in glitter.... and perfect for running around the park. No toe thong to rub her foot raw, in fact the straps are nicely adjustable so nothing has blistered her feet, even when stomping through water.
B005FM5Q3O Too Small My 2 1/2 yr old wears a toddler size 8, however these were way to small. She also didn't like the fact that they have &#34;ridges&#34; on the foot bed of the sandal. (There are cutouts of hearts)  She said that they didn't feel good on her feet.
B005FM5Q3O won't take them off his feet my three year old refuses to take them off his feet- not at the end of the schoolday or now that i want him in sneakers because of the colorer weather (in israel only now its &#34;cool&#34;).highly recommended.
B005FM5Q3O Great toddler shoe for around the yard The fact that these seemed to run a bit large is fine....the adjustable strap on the back will help the shoe to grow with my son.The sandal is well built and very sturdy. It took him a minute to be okay with the whole no socks thing, but he has taken it &#34;in stride&#34;.They are easy to get on and off.These are a great purchase for any active toddler and would be great on the beach or just romping around the yard.
B005FMBDD6 Really cute I really like these sandals. They give my 3 year old daughter's feet a little extra &#34;toe&#34; protection with the closed front. My only wish is that they came in half sizes. She's currently a size 9...and these fit without any wiggle room. A 9 1/2 would be better (10 would be too big). I would recommend, though.
B005GT116C Color and size not as expected -Even if mine are 11W in size, they were no &#34;W&#34;ide at all.-The actual color is not as in the picture. They are not like beige sand, they have a yellow tan like mustard.
B005GY98C6 Not what I was hoping for... To start, the shoes I received in the mail looked and wore like they had been previously owned. (That is a big strike against the merchant.) Next, the shoes were way too wide; although I have a long, narrow foot. However, the ill fit is a strike against the brand. Lastly, I didn't feel as though the construction of the shoe was very good either. All in all, this shoe gets an &#34;F&#34;. Maybe a &#34;D-&#34;... Either way, I sent them back.
B005GY98C6 Wrong Shoe The wrong shoe was sent to me, instead of receiving &#34;Timberland Men's Earthkeepers Lite Slip-on, Dark Brown/Brown, 9.5M US&#34;, I received &#34;Timberland Men's Chocorua Trail Slip-On&#34;.  Amazon refunded my money and I sent the shoes back and ordered them again and this time they sent the correct shoe.
B005I6RZXG Great Shoes I do not work on my feet all day, but I am too old to be wearing heels everyday. (even low ones) I wanted something that I could wear with my jeans but would still be acceptable for use with my &#34;business casual&#34; pants. These shoes were definately the right ones for both situations!! Very well made and extremely comfortable!!Be aware when ordering that they do run a little big. I usually wear a 7.5 but based on other reviews I went down a half size and they fit perfectly.
B005I6RZXG I love these shoes! I have wide feet and have not had much luck buying shoes on the internet. I took a chance on these shoes based on the reviews I read. I purchased my regular size in wide and they are perfect. These shoes were comfortable all day long with no blisters or rubbing from having to &#34;break them in&#34;.  I really do love them!
B005I6RZXG LEFT HEEL CUSHION DEFECTIVE..SLOSHING! The left heel cushion has no support in comparison to the right. I am in the process of returning them. I have 3 pairs of the same style so I know how they are supposed to  fit (LIKE YOU ARE WALKING ON A CLOUD! NOT SLOSHING AROUND!) They are way too expensive of a shoe for that. I don't know if these were &#34;seconds&#34; but I'm going to order another pair from TIMBERLAND directly or ALTREC where I have in the past and never got &#34;seconds!&#34;
B005I6RZXG Comfortable right out of the box! These are the most comfortable work shoes I have ever worn, and they do not require any &#34;breaking in&#34; time!
B005I6YJW6 Happy Hubby My husband now has 5 pairs of Timberland's.  He has steel toe ones for construction jobs - both over and under the ankle and he has non steel for working in his shop and around the yard.  He likes the fit and comfort so much that I have been told not to look at anything else other than Timberland when locating a &#34;work&#34; or &#34;yard&#34; shoe for him.  He says the support in them is great and he can go all day and his feet remain happy and comfortable.
B005I6Z4JI Great boot Just about .5&#34; longer than my other boots, but fit great.  Good quality. What else is there to expect from Timberland!
B005I6Z4JI Comfortable, but cheaply made. These boots are really comfortable.there really wasn't any &#34;Break-in&#34; time.  This is my 2nd pair.  My first pair after about a month, the shoe string broke through the plastic hole as I was lacing it up.  I kept using the boots, just had to lace them up by skipping the hole.I just bought a 2nd pair and on the 1st day one of the top &#34;hooks&#34; that you cross your lace in to broke off.  So I got some Gorilla Glue and glued that sucker back on there.  I let it dry for a week.  It worked for about a month, then flew across the room as I was putting them on yesterday.It's a shame.  These are really comfortable and will last a good year of wearing every day, but they are put together cheaply.  I think I'll buy another brand for my work boots.
B005I6Z4JI good quality, durable work boot fit comfortable right away, no &#34;breaking-in&#34; period.  quality, have purchased this same boot in the past.  Very durable work boot.
B005I6Z4JI They dropped the ball at the one yard line. These might have been my favorite work boots ever except for the one weakness the manufacturer insisted on adding to them. The fit was perfect. The comfort was fantastic. The durability was... well... GREAT except for the cheap, flimsy, plastic rivets.What they did, to an otherwise fantastic product, was use cheap plastic rivets to hold the lace hooks to the upper. One direct bump against one of these hooks and the rivet breaks, your hook falls out, which mine started doing and it was down hill from there.So often, I look at the corporate tie hangers who are responsible for this sort of &#34;cost saving&#34; idiocy and wonder if these people ever learn from shooting their company in the foot like this. I'm becoming more and more certain they do not. They can point to the money they've &#34;saved&#34; on a given project, by cutting corners, thus advancing their careers and that's that.Anyway, don't buy these &#34;would-a-been&#34; fantastic boots.
B005Y7T62W On my 3rd pair and still my favorites! My employer gives us a $100 boot allowance every year and it's pretty much impossible to get a decent pair of boots for that price. So, I've been spending close to $180 for these boots locally as there's only one place I know of that stocks them. I bought them from Amazon for about a third of that price! They stand up to 12 hr days on concrete and metal grating and hold up very well. And they allow me to be comfortable during those long days. The toes hold up well, too--they get scraped on the floor a lot due to kneeling down while working on conveyors, etc. After I use them a year at work, I wear them at home for work boots. The two old pairs I have still have plenty of life left in them, the worst wear being to the inside where my heel has rubbed through the liner some. They also seem to break in fast. The first day, they're a little uncomfortable due to being stiff, but on the second day I couldn't tell much difference from the old ones. The insoles are great out of the box, too.The only negative that I know if for some is that they run narrow. I have long skinny feet and I usually wear a medium (D) width. The mediums fit fine but the wide fits me better, where wide is normally way too wide for me.(Timberland labels a wide as &#34;W&#34;, whereas Amazon labels them &#34;2E&#34; {which to me and every other boot manufacturer means EE, as in extra wide-which is skipping size &#34;E&#34; and going straight to &#34;EE&#34;} Amazon needs to change their sizing description)
B0063MTW3K Smiling --Little -Toddler we have :) Momma called and said-----'' Great Auntie Connie -You sure know how to find boots --when you said --winter boots -you really meant winter boots- our little guy will not take them off let alone stop running around in them &#34;&#34; :):) Let's just say one thing here :):) Thank You for letting our little ones --stay little -just a little bit longer--and warm to :):) Package perfect :) With grand love indeed :):)
B006JFYVKU Great texture. Son is very fussy about &#34;bumpy&#34; socks and it has been hard finding him ones he likes.  These work really well.  High quality, thick enough for winter (he works outside).  Will continue to buy these.
B006OB62PQ Great quality at a great price. Way better than I expected. Comfortable, pragmatic and even good looking. I like the &#34;face page&#34; that lets me display my license without pulling it out (for cc confirmation purchases).
B006OVNL1E Comfortable fit Although there's &#34;kid size&#34; wording on the packaging, the socks fits as expected. I Loved it alot and will buy again.
B006T2EJC8 Like walking on a cloud! My husband said they were very comfortable from day one with no break in period...he is always on his feet and works with structural steel. They are the most comfortable work boot he has ever had and when he came home from work said, &#34;felt like walking on a cloud!&#34;
B006T2Z940 Decent but not great These are poor on icy surfaces, no traction whatsoever.  I have a pair of similarly priced tactical boots that gripped well on a surface that these failed on.  I like the styling, like being able to slip them on quickly without hassle.  Comfort is about what you'd expect in a boot of this type.  They are well made and durable, but the traction issues I've had will keep my rating at &#34;average&#34;.
B006T307QE Almost Too Comfortable When these boots came, I decided to try them on for a day and &#34;break them in&#34; for work. After a few minutes of walking, I realized that this would not be necessary as these boots are ready to go straight out of the box. I will test them under work conditions later, but as of right now,m these are some of the easiest &#34;on my feet&#34; work boots I have ever worn
B006T307QE Timberland PROs These boots are high quality, perfect fit boots that can &#34;pass&#34; for casual dress.  Absolutely comfort to wear all day.  It does not even feel like a heavy steel-toes work boot.  Amazing!
B006T307QE Wet foot I've barely owned these boots for 2 months and I can't even walk through wet grass without my foot getting wet. If you work in a dry area these are fine, but I bought them because they were &#34;waterproof&#34;. Very disappointed!
B006T32HGC Husband VERY pleased I purchased these for my husband as he had recently gone to work for the Railroad.  Walking on ballast (or comonly known as railroad rocks) was becoming very painful and causing serious bunions on his feet, we tried insoles and that only intensified the pain.  He was also desperately in need of a waterproof boot because if it rained he came home with shoes and socks soaked. (Not Good) He mentioned another guy at his job having this kind of boot that looked more like a tennis shoe.  So, I went to searching on Amazon to try and find this shoe he spoke of without telling him.  I found this Timberland PRO Boot I ordered it.  Not only was it approx. $20.00 cheaper than the &#34;Name Brand&#34; work boot he had purchased at the local boot store but it met all the specification he needed. 1. Waterproof 2. Had a 1&#34; heel 3. Most importanly comfortable.  He said this boot was comfortable from the time he put it on his feet, no break-in needed.  The pain from the rocks is still noticeable after many hours of standing and walking but not nearly as bad.  So thank you Timberland for making my husband's feet happy at his new job!
B006T32HSK Nice Comfortable Boot! Just got these and have worn them several times. Just wore them standing doing traffic control for a work zone(the &#34;stop/slow&#34; guy) in 15-20 degrees for a couple hours. My feet never even came close to getting cold and were comfortable to stand there with very little movement. Its my first pair of 8&#34; boots so it took some getting used to the higher boot but I have been VERY happy so far.
B006ZGV4GC SO COMFORTABLE AND &#34;SEXY&#34; LOOKING! LADIES, THESE HAVE TO BE THE MOST COMFORTABLE STYLISH BOOTS I'VE EVER BOUGHT! I LOVE THESE BOOTS SO MUCH!!! THEY LOOK GREAT WITH SKINNY JEANS!
B006ZGV9LM Love! After reading other reviews, I ordered 1/2 size up and glad I did.  With the extra room, I can wear a regular sock and the boot fits perfectly and comfortably.  Speaking of comfort - these are amazing.. with them being leather, they do not exactly &#34;move&#34; yet.. but today is the first day I have worn them...  and am certain that they will relax a bit with time.  They are fashionable, GREAT quality. wearing them with skinny jeans today (they look pretty HOT)... and while they did not stop me from sliding on the ice this morning.. they certainly did keep my feet dry and warm when I hit the one puddle that hadn't frozen over completely.I am a big fan of Timberland boots / shoes and am going back to order these boots in another color!This is not a case of like, or even lust... THIS IS LOVE!  :)
B006ZGV9LM Gorgeous Boots, worth the splurge... I searched quite a while online before I decided to purchase these lovely boots.  I realized every couple of years or so, I was purchasing a winter boot and by the end of the season, they looked pretty worn out. But, I was trying to save on expenses by purchasing boots lacking in substantial quality.  I have never purchased any shoes or boots from Timberland before and they seem to get rave reviews on all the sites I visited.  To me, the price tag was a bit steep, but I had enough of wasting money in the past on boots that didn't last.  Wow, I'm so happy I went with the recommendation of other reviewers.  They are simply THE perfect boot for the upcoming season!  They feel extremely comfortable.  I cannot stress that enough.  If I'm going to be in a pair of shoes for at least 8 hours, they must be comfortable or they're going straight back.  I tested these out and even ran in them, very easy to pull on with thinner and thicker socks.  The heel of the boot is so sturdy and perfect.  Not chunky in anyway and gives me the perfect amount of added height.  I really like the added detail in the back of the boot, so classic looking.  Also, they're not &#34;bunchy&#34; in the least, so they don't give the appearance of added width to your legs or ankles.  I found the shaft of the boot sufficient and they zipped up almost easily.  If you have wider or more muscular calves, this might pose a problem.  I love the &#34;anti-fatigue&#34; foot bed and that they're waterproof...feeling wet socks and toes during a rainstorm or snow storm can be quite uncomfortable.  So, I did my research on all the boots in this style before deciding on these lovely Timberland boots.  I think for the style, construction, quality, and price they are a definite buy! My two cents ;)**Important reminder** The black boots pictured above are of a wedge, which I was happy to receive, but what actually arrived is the black version of the brown and dark brown boots.  NO wedge and no buckle in the back, and no small side zipper.  So if you order the black, it might not be the wedge boots, but instead the heel boots.
B006ZGV9LM Great boot for the money I normally wear a 6.5 but went with a 7 due to recommendations from previous reviews.  I'm glad I did as the 7's fit perfectly.  The boots look great.  My only complaint is that the leather is really &#34;thick&#34; and, until I get the boots broken in more, it's hard to walk down stairs because the leather doesn't give.
B006ZGV9LM Really Nice As soon as I tried this boot on, it became my new fav.  Never thought I'd find a knee-high boot that fits my leg perfectly.  Heed the &#34;runs small&#34; warning.  Ordered half size up and it's perfect.
B006ZGV9LM Great Boots!!!! The name &#34;Timberland&#34; is synonymous with quality. These boots are no exception. Just really comfortable, well made cute-as-can-be boots. Fit = true to size. Calves = Nice and narrow.Buy them NOW!!!!
B006ZGV9LM Timberland Women's Stratham Heights Tall Boot,Black,7.5 M US Excellent!!! Very comfortable and look carefully at the foot. Stable. Like all &#34;Timberland&#34;'s shoes, which was acquired earlier, its practicality and quality workmanship! Lovely purchase!
B006ZIGRXA Compliments and Quality! At first I was a little unsure about these boots. Although I am average size with size Medium and 6 clothing I have oddly large muscular calfs. A family trait. Therefore finding boots that one, fit and two, don't accentuate my calfs can be a bit of a nightmare. As soon as they came in the mail I was in LOVE. They fit like a dream but they were not overly wide like some &#34;wide calf&#34; boots can be. (Finding middle ground seems to be a struggle for many) They are comfortable, durable and the quality is obvious. I received and still do receive copliments whenever I wear them.I was living and working in a national park at the time I bought these and they did great in the rough and active lifestyle...and all the dirt.I own these in dark brown and keep checking for the light brown/cognac to go on sale so I can afford another pair! =D
B006ZIGRXA Love these! If you are on the fence about these, go for it! These are a great price on Amazon. Still less than &#34;clearance price&#34; on a few other sites. Wore them the first time for a casual wine tasting day up in Murphys, Ca. Got so many compliments on them. I love that they are cute & casual. Definately complete your outfit without looking like you are &#34;trying too hard.&#34; Again, the first time I put them on, I wore them for the whole day. No break in period needed-- so glad I got them!
B006ZIGS34 Excellent Boot! As recommended by others, I ordered a wide width and they fit like a &#34;normal&#34; width. Straight from the box I wore them for several hours straight and surprisingly they were comfortable and I don't feel like they need to be broke in. I have received numerous compliments and they look fantastic dressed up or down. I got the olive color and I think they're pretty snazzy!
B006ZIGS34 Nice boots I do like these boots, I bought my regular size and they fit fine.  My only complaint is that they are very &#34;hard&#34; and stiff.  I have been trying to break them in for months now and think it may take up to a year or more.  I can wear them half a day, and then the toe area and where you bend your foot to walk become sore because of the hardness or stiffness of this boot.Other than that, they look nice, I am hoping they will become more comfortable because I bought these to use as my everyday boot and can't even wear them a full day yet.
B006ZIGS34 Great boots These boots are awesome.  Exactly what I've come to expect from Timberland.  I didn't even realize that they were completely waterproof when I bought them, but was thrilled to notice it when they came.  They're a great every-day boot, fit well, and are very comfortable. Plenty of room to fit skinnies into the shaft with no bulkiness or bunching.  I bought a sz 9 and have an average calf size--certainly not &#34;slim&#34; and not &#34;wide&#34; either.
B006ZSAEUW Great shoe, only one shortcoming I have always struggled with shoes because I'm a big guy with size 15 feet that are flat as can be.  I am forced to order online and end up returning about 50% or more for fit/comfort reasons.  These shoes, however, are not only keepers, but they're becoming my &#34;go to&#34; pair of athletic shoes for everything.  They're comfortable, durable (seemingly), and stylish.  What else could you want?If you made me complain, I would say there is one small shortcoming, and this is really not the manufacturers fault.  I debated bringing it up, but it might actually affect someone's decision, so I feel compelled to mention it.  For those of us with giant flat feet, the shoe doesn't really support your foot in the perfect position (then again, very few actually do).  I would prefer the shoe to have slightly more arch support, which helps to shift my foot over to the side a bit, keeping in in the &#34;proper&#34; position for walking, running, hiking, etc.  I put in some gel inserts and they do the trick though.SUGGESTION, I also ordered some orange 550 Paracord on Amazon and used it as shoelaces on these shoes.  It works perfectly, looks great, I'll never break a shoelace at the wrong time and if I ever need some extra rope/paracord while I'm out in the world, it's there.
B006ZTTV1O slip-on slip-off I really like these boots. I've looked at pictures here and on other sites and the &#34;burnished moss&#34; doesn't photograph correctly.  It's less green in real life than what you see on Amazon. It's less brown that what I'm seeing elsewhere. It's a great boot, but if you're looking for green or a very brown boot, you may be surprised when you receive these.Otherwise, the 10 fits like a 10. They have a good sole. And the laces do look dinky but I've never messed with them.
B0070SH5G2 Timberland Boots My husband loves the booots. He has been wearing them to  &#34;break them in.&#34;  They made one little place on is ankel. He puts lambs wool there, and that took care of the problem.
B0070SHSGE Read Reviews most of them are right. Order a half size small, even if you want to think you're a 12 get an 11.5.  I was like, &#34;half size smaller?  Pfft.  I'm definitely a 12.&#34;  and now I've got the shoes and they are great looking but they're TOO BIG.  Smooth, nice build.  Slight discomfort obviously on my error in getting too large of a shoe but the soles feel nice,  the look from top down looks classy enough for work and everyday use.  Not a wedding shoe or, &#34;hey take your girl to a super fancy restaurant even if your definition of super fancy is a dish more expensive than 20 dollars per person.&#34;Other things I've noticed while wearing for a week and a half while working at best buy and just everyday use through the gorgeous weather of Iowa right now. (it's not gorgeous by the way)Through the rough sleet, snow and rain, these things have taken a little bit of a beating, already noticing some small minor scuffs.  Nothing too huge but I'd be a bit concerned about how long these guys could last in my neck of the woods.I'll update as soon as I get my hands on an 11.5 pair of these shoes, off to a ups place to return these just to get a different size.
B0070SI95I IF THE BOOT "FITS" WEAR IT! YES FOLK'S- AMAZON OFFERED ANOTHER GOOD SELECTION!  AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I DID FIND THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY THE COMPANY'S TRUE &#34;ORIGINAL&#34; BOOT. THE QUALITY AND COLOR CHOICE OF BURNISHED WHEAT IS OUTSTANDING. I AGREE WITH PREVIOUS REVIEWS THAT THESE BOOTS RUN BIG BY A HALF A SIZE. MYSELF I ENJOYED THIS FEATURE ESPECIALLY WHEN WEARING A MEDIUM WEIGHT PAIR OF SOCKS-VERY VERY COMFORTABLE-GREAT BOOT FOR CASUAL WEAR-NOT FOR CLIMBING MOUNTAINS OR HEAVY WORK BUT VERY OUTSTANDING WITH A NICE PAIR OF JEANS. TO NICE TO GET MUDDY!  BEING A RETIRED IRONWORKER NOW I CAN  ENJOY A GREAT SET OF BOOTS- THANKS AMAZON- IRONMAN BRACKENRIDGE PA.
B0070SPKZU INCREDIBLE VALUE TIMBERLINE HAS COME UP WITH A BOOT THAT RESEMBLES A RED WING &#34;PARK RANGER&#34; FOR HALF THE PRICE.STYLE..COMFORT...QUALITY LEATHER. A WELL MADE BOOT.
B00710TZM6 Well made boot for active boys Bought for my son, who destroys most shoes even before he grows out of them (and his foot grows pretty fast).  These are sturdy and well made, so they might actually last a while.  My son is very happy with them.  They are comfortable and have a &#34;manly&#34; rugged look.  They are also waterproof (we have tried and tested this several times now) and good for the snow.  Only drawback are the laces, which need to be double knotted in order to stay tied (not the most kid friendly feature).
B007134C30 Great value I have looked several places for a dressier shoe for our Big Kid.  Many stores do not carry youth size shoes for my &#34;tween.&#34;  I was very pleased with this shoe and thought I got a great deal.
B0072AFBKK Nice boots This was a Christmas present for a young man.  I bought these because his were becoming somewhat torn and tattered.  So much for replacement&#8230;..  He is so pleased with these boots that he plans to continue to wear his old boots and keep these for &#34;dress&#34;.  Ah youth!
B0072AFBKK what a disappointment ! Amazon's service was excellent in everyday,  but Timberlands quality was terrible.The leather was cheap. It looked so even before I took the boots out of the box. They were was too narrow and too short.  I have had about 5 pair of White Ledge hikers that size in the past and they fit fine. The leather (looked like man made &#34;leather&#34;) was stiff and unnatural. Even the laces were to short making lt tough to put on. Wow, I hope all of Timberlands boots have not dropped in quality so drastically as these boots represent. Hey Timberland. What's up?
B0072NQIZ4 best work shoes ever Nurse and concrete floors for 12 hours.  Danskos were great for the first year, Allegras were great for a year.  Hopefully these will last longer than a year.  There is a ton of cushion at the heel, where I need it most.  There was no break in period like Danskos and light weight.  Slip proof bottoms are great.  Not all the fancy prints and patterns as dansko and allegras but they don't look like &#34;nursing shoes&#34;.  Probably going to buy another pair so I can rotate them.
B0072NQIZ4 Slam Dunk! I bought these for my wife because she works in a concessions area 8 hrs a day and needed some comfortable work shoes with slip resistant soles. I didn't necessarily want them to look like work shoes so I chose these.  I was a little nervous about spending &#34;big bucks&#34;, but in the end it was a great decision. She LOVES the comfort and style of of these shoes! She's gotten lots of compliments from others on how &#34;cool&#34; they look. She (and I) would definitely recommend these.
B007782V1O Recommend The color &#34;taupe&#34; was closer to olive. But anyway the boots are perfect Timberland, good for cold weather (smth till -5 C)
B007782V1O Great Shoes remain intact after &#34;long trip&#34; to ChinaGreat colar but too heavy, it is not fits for climbing hills, it broken at the first day I weared it, because the shoes kick the stone while mountain-climbing ...
B007782V1O Wearing them for the first time right now The reason I am writing this review is because I was confused about what color I was actually going to get in the mail.  I ordered what is labeled as Taupe but the picture is actually Olive.  I ordered this color because it is half the price as the other colors, and I was more interested in a cheap, reliable, comfortable, functional boot rather than fashionable.  I think that the color of my boot matches the color of the picture of what I ordered (when I image-googled &#34;Timberland Olive&#34; and &#34;Timberland Taupe&#34; I found varying pictures which confused me further).  That being said, I am very pleased... I bought these for a trip to Iceland that I am taking this summer, and they seem to be quite sturdy -- just what I need for my trip.  I've been wearing them around the house and they're comfortable, hopefully it will be that way after walking around Icelandic wilderness for hours!Here are some other things to consider:-- They run small/narrow.  I typically wear a 6-6.5 and my feet fit most normal width shoes but are on the wider side... I ordered a 6.5 regular width and they're a little snug but wearable.  I think wearing thick socks might be pushing it.  For a second I considered exchanging them for a wider width, but I don't think that it is absolutely necessary and don't feel like going through the hassle.  If you're wide at all, I would suggest going for the wide option.  If you're between sizes SIZE UP (cannot stress this enough, because honestly I might be able to comfortably wear a 7 in these boots).-- They are difficult getting on/off.  Like I said, these shoes are a tight squeeze.  If you're looking for something to slip on easily, these aren't for you. (I wish these had hooks instead of grommets at the top!)-- The fleece is only around the ankle, not in the footbed.  I could see toes getting cold in snow because of this, but I still anticipate it being warm enough for what I am intending them for.-- These seem like they will be okay in wet weather, but I plan on weather proofing them just in case.-- I was initially hesitant to purchase what is labeled &#34;Taupe&#34; because I was scared I would get a color that was too light to walk around with in the mud.  In the end I planned on being happy with whatever color I got... if you're cheap (like me) and flexible, just go for the cheaper option and save $40, because I think the color that I have will be versatile and will not show stains.
B0077853PU So comfy...so many compliments I've received so many compliments on these boots, and they were comfortable on the very first wear.  There was no &#34;breaking in&#34; period.
B007G4VE30 Great Real happy with this wallet.  I like it a lot.  If you are somebody with a million cards there might not be enough room.  A few more &#34;pockets&#34; would be nice.
B007G4VPNY Timberland is always good quality leather The leather is beautiful and soft.  The kind of finish that will look good as it &#34;ages&#34; and becomes distressed.  Will be enjoyed for many years.
B0080CACC6 Better than most so-called boot socks These are just right in so many ways. They come in various colors and can be worn with &#34;business casual&#34; attire or real boots. If you have shoes or sneakers that are just a tad too big, they can take up the slack and make for a comfortable fit. They are not super soft but they have been durable and certainly worth the money over big-box big-name &#34;boot socks&#34;.
B0080CACC6 Best socks for cold climes... I have small feet, and these have fit perfectly. I was concerned that the &#34;one size&#34; thing would make them too big. They are super warm and well-cushioned. Worth every penny.
B008B5XIEQ Very useful for human smuggling This suitcase is, as all the transplanted Brooklynites now say, &#34;vagynormous.&#34; Unless you're extremely strong, you are likely to fill it up to the point of barely being able to move it up a flight of stairs.Ergonomics are good--it's easy to pull and navigate space with, thanks to its narrow and oblong shape and its pair of large wheels fixed on one axis. You pull it tilted, and this is for the better. Those fancy suitcases with 4 wheels that spin around, tempting you to dance with them on smooth airport floors but a pain on any rough terrain, tend to break much more easily and turn themselves into junk.The zippers on this suitcase are very strong and confidence-inspiring. Organization is minimal, or &#34;minimalist&#34;: it's basically one big whole for you just to throw everything in and call it a day. Good for moving and long-distance trips, not ideal (though acceptable) for repeated unpackings and repackings. For that try theI have successfully smuggled several legal immigrants (two together in one instance) into the US in this suitcase to safe the airfare.
B008FA81Y4 Timberland for Overland Like the quality of the set but returned it because I realized the large 30&#34; bag is just too large for my needs and would get very heavy very easily.  For upcoming air travel, I prefer, and will now look for, a two piece set including the carry on and the 26&#34; check-in.  If your needs can use the larger size, I think you could easily like this set.
B008H2BBUG can't touch this These are far the coolest looking boots I have ever owned. The style alone is worth five starts however the bonus is a perfect fit and added durability to &#34;boot&#34;!
B008IZ7JXA Well worth it Durably made. Very large compartments. Plenty of compartments for various items. I luv the boot bag, the durable wheels & the sturdy handle. Perfect carry on rolling luggage for the &#34;ruff&#34; individual.
B008J0PKIA Off grey color The shoes are &#34;ok&#34;.  They look so soft and pretty in the picture but when I got them they are an odd almost taupe-grey color that doesn't match any of my grey slacks.  They are slightly tight in the toe, but otherwise fit well.  I kept them, but am still looking for that perfect pair of slacks to wear them with...
B008J0PKIA shoes should fit like this one I love these shoes because they fit perfectly on my feet and they are very comfortable to walk in.  I only wear comfortable shoes and this one fits me to a &#34;T&#34;.
B008KLEYLM wow they smell bad! It's such a shame... I wore these shoes the first couple of times and was so pleased because they needed no  &#34;break in&#34; period. I had no sore spots or blisters and wore them with no socks. I was so happy! Unfortunately after the 5th time they started to smell horrible, it was very embarrassing when I took them off. I had to immediately wash my feet thoroughly.  I'm going to have to toss these in the trash, what a waste.  Maryjane's are supposed to be worn with no socks.  I'm going to try Born maryjane's, they are lined in full leather.
B008KLEYLM So comfortable!! I got these in a size 11 (because my feet swell) but turns out even with swelling there are too big. But the best part is they are sooooo comfortable that my swelling has reduced a lot. The price was a total steal!! I love that they use environment friendly packaging and the total &#34;green&#34; concept that backs these shoes.
B008M27UHO Too Bad I used to LOVE Timberland products. After wearing the &#34;Timberland Men's Hulls Cove Boat Shoe&#34; for about a month, the back heel started to come apart.  I have been using Timberland products for over thirty years. It may be time for a change. I suppose &#8220;Planned Obsolescence&#8221;  is the new norm.
B008M2MGSC Great fit, looks and price I have read some of the other product reviews, some say to &#34;Get a size bigger&#34;...I say to just GET YOUR SIZE. I wasn't sure on what size to get until,I actually got my pair and wore it. It fits as regular shoes/boots would. Though it does have little to no cushion on your feet,you could just wear thicker/comfier socks. It doesn't take much to break it in to get rid of the stiffness. ITS  WORTH WHAT I PAID FOR. I got a lot of compliments on them. The product was DELIVERED ON TIME.
B008M2MGSC Transcendent footwear I have been searching for something, something missing that was destined to be part of me, and here it is!  Footwear most excellent. Is it a boot?  A sneaker?  both or neither?  A beaker maybe.  Whatever, this &#34;classic&#34; style is fresh as can be and is perfect footwear.  Got these last fall and I have never, ever, had so many complements or interest in my shoes.  My wife and I were in Burlington, VT for a college tour for our nephew and I had students complementing me (I am 58!) on my Timberlands.  Then there was a Dansko sale in one of the local hotels.  We were in there hours as my wife tried on a billion clogs. As I waited, I had two different sales people come over to ask about these Timberland Newmarkets, I overheard one of them tell a third salesperson ...&#34;they're Timberlands, cool huh?&#34;  Don't worry Dansko, we did plenty of damage buying clogs that day.  These suit me perfectly, fit great, and are about the most comfortable thing ever.  The style is completely unique without being too crazy.  Wore them through the New England winter and they look like new - thanks Timberland.  I did apply a nubuck protective spray which is probably a good idea if you see these taking all kinds of weather.  I know the soles won't last forever, so I am getting a backup pair soon.  Wow do I like these.
B008M2OCP2 Too lightly made Not that it isn't quality, just not enough padding in the heel for me.  It feels a lot like a &#34;natural walker&#34; shoe for people who want their shoes to feel like they aren't wearing any shoes.  That's great if you want that, but if you walk heel to toe like most people, this shoes gets painful.I returned it.
B008M2YZKY Look and feel great These shoes look great and are much more comfortable than most similar shoes due to their gel insoles.  They also tighten well and secure my foot well.  The leather tab on the back looks great and is functional.  My only concern is durability.  I haven't worn them heavily (couple times a week for most of a summer), yet there are signs of stitching coming out already.I'm normally 11.5-12 (even in Timberland), but I got these in 10.5.  They were a little tight at first, but definitely the right call.  The &#34;light grey&#34; has a light blue-ish hue.
B008M4UN1C Can't stop wearing them I tried a higher wedge version of this shoe on in a store and was really pleased with the comfort of the shoe overall. Since they arrived I haven't wanted to wear any other shoes. They were comfortable (no rubbing, good support) from the beginning. No dreaded &#34;breaking in&#34; period.I'm a mom to a young toddler and wanted a shoe with a bit of style and plenty of comfort that would be easy to dash around in. That's exactly what I got. Very pleased overall.
B008MHR6D2 Brilliant boat shoes Fits perfectly. Not too casual and goes well with cargos and jeans. Bought it cuz' it's &#34;featured in GQ&#34;. Well done Timberland !
B008N7H654 Comfortable Was a bit worried about how comfortable these would be while fishing tournaments.  The soles are relatively thin and I figured they might be a little &#34;stiff&#34;.  Luckily, I was wrong.  Took a chance and spent the extra money on Timberlands due to some recent successes with this brand.  This is my 3rd pair of Timberlands in the past couple of months and I have to say, I love all 3 of them.  They may be ventilated and I remember reading something about them draining water but not sure that will happen as there don't appear to be any drain holes lower on the shoe.  Never-the-less, comfortable and easy to wear while spending a full day on your feet.
B008T65HI2 lovelly ones! every one of my nephew's friends love his Timberland and he almost  trade them for another more expensive ones.But because it was a give from me.He said &#34;No, no my lovely ones&#34;
B008VAQ1UY Great shoes! Bought for my 4 year old for our &#34;nature hikes&#34; and he loves them. He's never complained about the fit and they seem to be true to size.  Very good product.
B008VAQ1UY Almost perfect for my son. These were a great price when I purchased them for my son and that was part of the reason I decided to go with them.  The other was that I assumed they were bungee laces since the descriptions says &#34;Bungee&#34; oxford.  We received actual laces with the shoes and they do not stay tied for anything.  But we will make them work until he grows out of them.
B008VPU0GK I liked these, but they are too small.  Not good if you need orthotics in your shoes These are nicely built, seem very sturdy, but not good if you wear orthotics as they sit up too high and the boot is cut low across the top of your foot.  It's a shame, I liked the look and build quality, just not comfortable.  In the big &#34;D&#34; I wear an 11 EE, these timberlands are much more narrow and not as long, even in the wide version.  For most, they may be great.  For someone like me with orthotics they are not.
B008VS521K Very comfortable to wear. It fits well. 34 yards feet for 2M us.
B008ZBPGFU Comfortable and styling I ordered these for my husband as he was wearing what I called &#34;old man&#34; slippers. And, even though he is old, he should still look good. These slippers are so sharp and so comfortable and he is thrilled with the gift. 5 stars all the way around.
B008ZBPGFU Great, very comfy shoe. Normally wear size 9.5 - 10. Size 10 fits perfect. Very very comfortable shoe. Feels like walking on pillows but yet very sturdy for &#34;lounger&#34; style shoes. Highly recommend and very stylish. Great with jeans or khaki's.
B0090X4EJQ Timberland footwear rocks! I work in construction and have to balance between job-site and the office. These shoes are phenomenal! They are stylish enough to meet with clients and are tough too. In the last month I have had at least 3 days when I spent most of the day doing &#34;light demo&#34; and haul out of debris, and the shoes were as comfortable as my boots. They wiped down nice and clean. I should mention that my boots are Timberland as well. Both are comfortable and perform well.Timberland is my work shoe!
B0090X4EJQ Trying to like them I rated fit as to small because the foot opening is small and for a slip on it makes them difficult to well &#34;slip on&#34;. Also with this narrow foot opening they kind of have a tight feeling even with them having elastic stretch material built in. I'm trying to like these shoes and all most returned them but thinking maybe they will stretch a little I'm going to keep them and see if I can &#34;like them&#34;.
B0090X4EJQ Excellent shoe. Have been a longtime &#34;Timberland boot guy&#34; and tried one of their &#34;frequent flier friendly&#34; shoes years ago and found them so comfortable that I bought a little supply. After my supply ran out and unable to find the old style, I tried other models and makes including Dockers and found them fitting OK, but not as comfortable as old Timberlands. The Timberlands fit me perfectly and after a day of travelling with a few connecting flights at the opposite ends of the airport, my feet still felt good. I did buy a size 8 as well, but returned it because they were just a bit too tight. The size difference was little and best described as to what types of socks you wear (dress or cottons ones) I wear cotton ones. Since I am not a selfish person (LOL) I will recommend these shoes.
B00911DNDA The Absolute Best!!! Love These Shoes! I have bought several other types of &#34;Timberlands&#34; but these are my favorite. Usual great quality and design. They are light weight and give a spring to my step. Love the way the laces feed. Look great with jeans, shorts. Could walk all day....sometimes do:) Purchased through &#34;Wakestein&#34; at Amazon and couldn't be more pleased with their prompt delivery and customer service on this and other orders too. It's rare I give a recomendation but everything about this purchase was A+++.
B0091225MO Terrible stability I had these shoes for 3 months. From the start the feel when walking was &#34;squishy&#34;. As time passed beyond 30 days, I noticed I began to walk on the inside of my heel. A co-worker said I walked like a &#34;fat person&#34; w/ worn out sneakers. Too late to return them. I bought Danner instead and they are working out much better.''
B0091248VU awesome boots the boots fit a half size large, but that's OK.  the insole is none too soft, so i strongly recommend a cushioned insole.  the soles are good and tough.  i walk nearly 3 miles a night on concrete at my job and i've had these boots nearly a month and there's been absolutely NO wear.i only wish that the top 2 eyelets were &#34;quick loops&#34; so they were easier to lace up.
B0091HHY0W Ok Composted toe just like steel toe non flexible enough for my type of work &#34; too hard&#34; for me hardwood floor
B0098X5DAM Excellent Exactly as described. Shoe is nice despite a little heavy.  Choosing &#34;wide&#34; was a right choose as it feels very comfortable wearing it.
B0098X5DAM Love these shoes I am a convert from Born slide on clogs to these Timberland shoes.  They are still new, but didn't have that &#34;new and need to be broken in feeling&#34;.  They are so comfortable for walking around and standing. Also love that they came in wide, so I was able to go down a 1/2 size and still have room for thicker winter socks.  I would definitely recommend trying them!!
B009OL2L94 Just ok I was looking for more of a &#34;work&#34; boot.. These boots are almost too lightweight. They are comfy but not great for protection.
B009R9EJ3E Ok Much too expensive for the comfort achieved.  I thought there would be more &#34;softness&#34; with these.  Would not purchase again.
B009TAVOHK Good traction, but hot feet The boots have very good traction and are very light. The bad thing is hot feet: I bought it because of the description &#34;Textile windows for breathability&#34;, but its breathability was much worse than those of my leather boots without textile windows.
B009XEYBTA Time for pair #2 The only problem I had with this shoe is the sole isn't as padded as it looks.  They aren't uncomfortable, by any means, but I expected &#34;dreamy&#34; cushion & got good enough cushion.  Absolutely love them as my hang out at the camper shoes, which is what I bought them for.  I wore them for a long day of walking & they still did great, feet didn't hurt at all.  They also look cute as a casual go out in jeans shoe! True to size. I wouldn't hesitate to order another pair!
B009XF0GJ8 Fits JUST Right I wear a woman's 9 shoe and I fill these up. Toe comes to the very end. I wouldn't describe them as too tight. I've only worn them 4 times so they are not really broke in yet. Plus, I have been wearing thin athletic socks. I think, come summer time, these will be just right. They are very comfortable shoes and I have gotten several compliments on them. They are definitely &#34;knockabout&#34; shoes though; no real arch support to speak of and I just don't think they would be good for walking for long periods of time.
B00AQMB9O8 Very Solid Boot for Fall/Winter These boots appear to be top quality and among the few that come in 1/2 sizes.  My daughter has an &#34;anti-girly&#34; attitude and was very happy with these. I'm happy because they will give her good traction on wet stairs and sidewalks.
B00ATDTCQG Great shoe for Toddlers Great fit and very stylish. I don't know if it is officially rated &#34;waterproof&#34; but my grandsons play in the snow with theirs and I get no complaints about wet socks. Timberland shoes are always on trend and are much more comfortable for outdoor winter play than snow boots or tennis shoes.
B00ATDU5M6 Timberland Euro Hiker I am very satisfied with Amazon and will continue to order from them.  Whatever I have purchased has been to my satisfaction and if not I have not had any problem sending it back for a refund or exchange.  If any item had to go back it's because the person I purchased it for was not happy with it because it was not what was expected, but so far, I've been very happy doing business with Amazon, I wish they would go back to the &#34;tax free&#34; purchases
B00AW7M97S Teen Daughter Loves It 13 y.o. daughter wanted &#34;combat boots&#34;. She has wide feet with double bunions, and we're going into rainy season with no waterproof shoes (seen any teenagers wearing wellies lately?). So the challenge was finding something durable, comfortable, could double as a rainboot, and that she liked. Oh yeah, and that did not cost $400. The Timberland Savin Hill Boot turned out to fit the bill! Love that it comes in wide (C/D), is real leather construction so will last and not crack like synthetic, and can be easily waterproofed. My daughter wears them with skinny jeans, and although they have low heels (in fact, they are comfortable enough for her to run in them), they make her &#34;feel tall&#34; because of the long leg line.
B00AW7M97S Gorgeous boot Wow, beautiful boots!  The leather is just gorgeous, and so soft.  I ordered them in &#34;wheat&#34;, a neutral brown color with slight red undertones.  I was happy to see they are not as red as they look in the picture.  I usually wear and 8.5-9.  I ordered a 9B, and they fit perfectly.  I do have narrow feet as well.  I looked at several websites, and Amazon had the lowest price so I feel like I got an amazing deal on such high quality boots.  Very happy!
B00AW7M97S Finally got the right fit, and Amazon fixed the color description problem! I ordered 4 pairs of these boots to find the right fit. I tried 8, 7.5, 7M and 7W. The 7W were the ones I ended up keeping mainly because I felt like I'd gotten the fit &#34;good enough&#34; and was tired of ordering so many pairs of boots. Secondly, the 7Ws arrived in the lighter brown color instead of the red-brown color, and I decided I really liked the neutral brown. Now, Amazon is selling the neutral brown under the category &#34;Wheat&#34; and the red-brown under &#34;Brown.&#34; Many customers complained about this problem, and Amazon fixed it! Hooray!The fit is tight when you first put the boots on, but they relax quite a bit even within the first 20 minutes of wear. For a little while after I decided to keep them, I was worried I erred too much on a tight fit and got a size that was too small. But, after a few weeks of wearing the boots with very thick socks, they fit great now with even my regular tall gym sock.I am really really pleased with my purchase, especially since I was able to get them for $70 with a coupon Amazon was offering around the holidays in 2013. The leather is really nice, and they waterproofed nicely with a spray I got from a sporting goods store. I love the side zip to take them off easily, and the boots just look good overall.
B00AW7M97S Practical boots. These are nice boots, comfortable, practical but beware they are a little snug. I got my usual 7 1/2 and they fit OK but I cannot wear heavy socks with them. My foot is fairly slim and if yours is not you might want to go up a half size. I got them on account of the &#34;anti-fatigue&#34; sole and they do provide good support.
B00AW7M97S Great so far! These boots look great, I was hesitant to order them on-line but couldn't find them in a store anywhere close by so I gambled. They look very high quality and feel quite warm. I live in Florida so I won't be wearing them that much. I wear a size 8, ordered a size 8 and they fit perfectly. The calf is snug but not so much that it is uncomfortable and I hate gapping on higher boots so for me it is perfect. If you have large calves it may be an issue, especially if wearing thicker jeans and socks. We are going to Gatlinburg in a few weeks where they will have there first &#34;outing&#34;. We'll be doing some hiking and lots of walking I suspect so I will update my review at that point. On pure looks alone and initial comfort - A plus!
B00AW7M97S Very comfortable - like all Timberland boots.... Very comfortable - like all Timberland boots.......a little more &#34;red&#34; then I expected, but still a great boot and fun to wear!
B00AW7M97S Best Military Style Boots Ever! I got these pair of boots for my fifteen year old daughter,  and she loves them!  The quality is unbeatable. She wore them to school today for the first time and got many compliments. She told me they are comfortable and fit just right. / Before I found this nice pair of boots I got her a pair of G by Guess &#34;Frolic&#34; Combat boots and I was very dissapointed because the quality was horrible... you get what you pay for.  Glad I found Timberland!
B00AW7M97S Great boots mediocre fit I want to start by saying that I LOVE these boots. They came prime shipping (2 days) and looked exactly as pictured. Color (wheat) was just as pictured as well. I read ahead of time that these boots run small, I typically wear 8.5 in real leather boots 9 if they run small, the leather typically gives a bit and after a few days of snug wear they fit fine. I got size 9, put them on and thought wow these ARE small. I refused to give up, laced them up and wore them out for a day. Day one was tough, had some rubbing by my toes. The boots are very narrow all through the ankle and even the toe has less room than I'd enjoy. Put them on today to attempt day two of &#34;stretching them out&#34; and it's impossible. Super disappointed but I'm going to have to return them because it's evident that they won't be &#34;giving&#34; like a lot of other boots I've owned. I don't think I'll be ordering a half size up because they just seem to rigid of a boot and weren't quite as comfortable as I'd like. I'm giving them 3 stars because they are a solid and gorgeous boot if you can fit in them correctly.
B00AW7M97S Timberland Boots I luv these boots!!! Have been looking for a &#34;feminine&#34; combat boot for a while.  These definitely fit the bill. I usually wear an 8 1/2, but ordered the 9, to be able to wear thicker socks. Plenty of &#34;wiggle&#34; room. I normally only buy black boots, so, decided to try the dark brown this time. The color is true to the picture on my screen, a rich, dark, brown.  Haven't worn them outside yet, but did wear them in the house for about 8 hours. No rubbing anywhere, & comfortable. I am not a believer of &#34;breaking in&#34; shoes or boots, they're either comfy, or not!  Also, I have somewhat chubby calves, & there's enough room to wear these boots with jeans tucked in, without having to adjust the laces. Very happy with this purchase, got them on sale, but they're worth paying full price, too! Good quality & well made. Look like they'll last forever!!! Amazon is the BEST with quick service  & customer service!  Highly recommend.
B00AW7M97S Great boots! I received the boots and I love them!  Super well made and comfortable!  Boot is so very well made, I was super impressed. No noisy sound as you walk down the hallways at work either.  The color says &#34;brown&#34; but definitely has a red undertone.  Super pretty and have gotten many compliments.  Each day feels better as they break in too.  Details are so nice, suede makes them so fancy too.  Fits perfect and can be tightened with laces if wish.  I love them so much I now ordered in black!
B00AW7M97S Love these boots! I wear a 6.5 medium very consistently. My feet are neither narrow nor wide. But there was a lot of varying opinion on sizing for these so I took a chance on going up to a 7 medium and it worked out great.I like to wear them paired with the kind of &#34;athletic&#34; crew sock. The kind that have the slight padding in the heel, the tighter arch support and the odor/&#34;wick away&#34; material. It's not the kind of sock you might think to go with but I tried a number of &#34;boot&#34; socks and they were all too thick and uncomfortable. I find the crew cut version of the socks marketed more for athletic activities work out really the best.The full side zipper makes them easy to get into. And I love that I can tighten down the laces for a more personalized fit. I have small calves and tightening the laces and buckle gives me a smooth, sleek fit without sacrificing ease of getting them on and off.I've had no squeaks, no pinching and no binding when wearing them. The leather stands up just fine to a rainstorm and puddles with nice, dry socks and feet.I really love these and look forward to every time I wear them!
B00AW7M97S Getting a lot of use out of these. I did not expect to wear these so much but they are warm and comfy, the fit is just right.  I'd call the calf medium, and it's adjustable to a point.  I can wear leggings or light pants tucked in or tighten them up to wear under slacks if I want - I like the contrast of the smoother leather with the suede and the slightly distressed look.  Not too tough looking, more like &#34;rustic&#34;.  Bought the &#34;wheat&#34; color and they are a medium warm brown.  Very nice.
B00AW7RBGC very comfortable! These fit my feet well, like my other Timberland shoes and boots, The short top and low heel make them comfortable to wear all day.I used mink oil to &#34;waterproof&#34; them before wearing, and the leather looks and wears well.
B00AW7RBGC Not impressed This boot is what i what looking for but for a &#34;wide width&#34; it's very narrow. I had to return them.
B00AW7RBGC Comfortable and sturdy walking boot! I highly recommend this boot. No break-in time needed. I walk about a mile each day to work (uphill at the end of each trip) and this was super comfortable and sturdy. There's a little more space which is perfect for wool socks if desired. Waterproof feature is great for rainy days too! The Tobacco color is a more natural brown than the actual version called &#34;Brown&#34; (which is more reddish brown).
B00AW7RBGC NIce! I typically wear a 7 or 7.5...ordered the 7.5.  While they are a bit snug across the top of my foot, I think that is just part of the &#34;cowboy boot&#34; styling.  They are very comfortable and I think the will break in and be even more comfortable.  I do wish they had a bit more tread on the bottom, but I knew there was not much when I ordered them.
B00AW7RBGC Not the Timberland I Remember This is a cute boot and I've had great luck with Timberland in the past, but it seems things have changed. My last boots were Timberland and I wore them, comfortably, for twelve years before I wore them out. This boot runs narrow, and while I can wear it, it is not comfortable. I thought these would be the &#34;go to&#34; boots for the season, but have only worn them a handful of times. When deciding what to wear, I see these in my closet and think, &#34;Umm . . . No, not comfy enough,&#34; and choose something else. They may stretch over time, if I were willing to tolerate the discomfort in trying to &#34;break them in,&#34; but, truly, they are just too narrow and ill-proportioned to be the boots I was hoping they'd be. I'd rather have the money back in my pocket and the boots out of my closet, if I could do it over.
B00AW8HF9Y Great boots!! I absolutely love these boots. I read some of the other comments and the one thing I can say is if you have thick calves do NOT buy these boots.  One of the reasons I like them so much is because I have trouble finding good boots for thinner calves and I don't like when there is a big gap of space between my leg and the boot.  They are a little stiff at first but as you wear them they &#34;loosen up.&#34; I had to buy a 1/2 size bigger then I normally wear but they fit great.
B00AW8HF9Y Loved the quality and styling of this boot Loved the quality and styling of this boot, but it appears to be made for women who do not have calves.  If you are of &#34;sturdy Celtic stock&#34; like myself, this may not work for you
B00AW8HF9Y Only for those with smaller calves I have about 13.5&#34; calves which, I don't think is particularly large or small since I'm 5'3&#34;. I ordered these boots in a 7W after reading a lot of the reviews. I have to say, the length of the boot is fine, but the width is SO narrow, and everything is super stiff when you first get it. It's like walking around in rainboots. The calves on the boots I got had a circumference of a little less than 14&#34;. If you have larger calves this is definitely not the boot for you.Other than the fit, the boots are really hard to break in. You have to really wear them and deal with them, but in my opinion they're worth it. They do get scratched easier than I expected, but overall not a bad boot. the sole is really nice for the winter because it does give you that much needed traction.
B00AW8HF9Y Timberland Putnam Knee high Boot These boots are my second try from this company. I bought a different pair and they were too small, and unfortunately they were not sold in Wide sizes. So these were the back-up plan. All in all, they aren't bad. The shaft of the boot is really really stiff. I waited almost a month before writing this review because I wanted to give them a chance to &#34;break in&#34;. If you love these boots, then don't give up on the breaking in time. They are still alittle tight every time I put them on and the support for the ball of my foot isn't comfy. The tread seems thin and is rather uncomfortable, good type of boot to wear boot socks. They are plain, no bells or whistles, and they are real leather with fading on the toe and heel. It isn't as noticeable in person as on the internet. It took me a long time to get used to these boots, but budget demands that I get used to them;)I would not buy them again.
B00AW8J5RE Comfortable, stylish and versatile. I work for a design/build firm and needed something that could transition from the field to the office if necessary.  These definitely fit the bill, the only thing it is missing is &#34;steel toe&#34; but that is less necessary for me.  I have warn them all day several times now and find they are quite comfortable.  And they are so stylish that they have become one of my favorite go-to fall shoes, even when I'm not going onto a job site.
B00AW8J5RE THESE BOOTS WERE MADE FOR WALKING! I had tried to get these from Timberland Direct they were out of stock so I tried Amazon ...Boom there they were!! Yes!!!brings back a lot of child hood memories!!!I never had these as a &#34;Tomboy&#34; growing up so I bought them. They were a little pricy but I purchased them anyway.Thank you Amazon for making me a Grown Child running &#34;WILD&#34;&#34;
B00AW8JG9G Totally amazing! Can wear all day- SUPER happy! My husband and I searched FRYE boots online for over a year to find a pair for me...the price always left a bad taste in our mouths, so we never bought. Somehow, we landed upon this boot and the ratings were through the roof!...I know why! This boot is AMAZINGLY comfortable! I can literally wear them all day (I have 3 kids under 6 and am very active) and I don't feel like I've worn a shoe at all. I ordered an 8- my true fit- and it fits perfectly. I was worried about the &#34;calf&#34; measurement after reading reviews...I took out my measuring tape, and I have a 12.5&#34; calf. There is a 3-hole adjustment strap at the top and mine is on the tightest. There is still some wiggle room, but it feels fine with jeans underneath. My husband has said over and over, &#34;Those boots look SO good!&#34; ...every time I wear them. (the leather detailing down the back looks great) At $130, I feel I got the best Christmas present ever!
B00AW8JG9G CLASSIC, REAL Leather, Comfortable easy walking boot.Wider fit on foot. No for wide calf wearers Real Leather, cushion sole, wider toe box, comfortable,do not slump.If you are looking for real leather boot this is it. These are the &#34;let me slip on my boots&#34; and lets go run errands type. As soon as I tried these on in store I felt a soft cushion sole as I walked whether it be carpet or hard surface. Not that slippery or hard clunky heel feel. The instep is not too steep with its 1&#34; heel, no forward pressure on ball of foot as I walked. I had been trying on literally over 20 pairs (White Mountain,Ecco,Rampage,Coach,Merrell,B.O.C + many more) and none met the &#34;right one.&#34;(Although a Michael Kors dressier boot with gold accents made the cut but not for casual wear I was looking for.)I usually wear a size 8 and in a wide 8 in a Brooke tennis shoes for wider toe box and insert and orthotic insert. The size 8 in Timberland fit comfortably, but the right boot did not allow my toes to completely wiggle-spread out or avoid the big toe and second toe feeling overlapped (while wearing acrylic knee highs). When standing flat on a ruler my widest part of foot I measure  3-5/8&#34; and length heel to tip of toe 9-5/8&#34; so an 8 would fit almost perfect.  For the tighter toes I chose to go up to the 8.5 though. The only compromise this did was a slippage in the heel and easily fixed with thicker wool/hunting type socks. Now I have cushion & warmth. The boot had plenty of room for the socks too, I can wear my slim jeans or boot cut tuck in easily. I think this boot does benefit from a thicker sock as back heel area inside feels firm but not rubbing.  Store didn't have the right color in my size and price on Amazon past weekend was $110 less than Nordstrom and with a promo code 20% was able to purchase two pairs for less than one at a local store!  I also used small same day ship fee and ordered at night and doorbell rang at 10am with two pairs of boots. The store had told me this style had been treated at manufacture for water protection & waterproof, however cannot find this on the Timberland website so plan on applying a spray for elements this winter.Measurements:1&#34; rubber heel14-1/2&#34; inside height, 16&#34; outside height from floor to top of boot -size 8.5 measured14-3/4&#34; inside circumference measured 1&#34; down from top of boot -a size 8.5 boot,no stretch is gussetmy calf is 13&#34; and fits with boot cut jeans + plenty room for hand to slip in, 1&#34; extra I'd saysize 8.5 - my foot measures when standing on a ruler 9-5/8&#34; and 3-5/8&#34; across widest partFor sake of measuring calf fit, I put a plush Mickey Mouse doll into boot head first to see how wide a calf it might accept. With Mickey's head I zipped around and boot can handle 16-1/2&#34; I'd say tightly. This is not a wide calf type person boot.I learned Wide in boots means calf fit. Normally when I order a wide tennis shoe, it increases the toe box etc, however in boots &#34;wide&#34; fit changes the top circumference of boot around calf part, nothing to do with shoe part of boot, so a wide boot for me made the boot top look like wader fishing boots. I did see these come in wide on Timberland site.Details:-Boot has 1/4&#34; wide accent of suede lattice woven up back of boot, and in strap across arch of foot-Top outside of boot has adjustable elastic gusset for expansion, or to adjust to pant thickness-Side brass accent buckle -adjustable but do not see it as that functional.Strap is not tight and moves so loosening would not make a difference and tightening would affect how it lies on boot.-Lining-smooth eco recycled material, full length thick brass zipper is not exposed as leather flap overlap inside-Full length inside leg zipper-easy to get into if thicker or high instep-Sole-all rubber, good traction-Black -matte finish, buttery with slight pebbling (amount of pebbling varied between store and Amazon)-Brown- muted,color accurate on website, more of a slicker feel than black. Remind me of Frye boots I had 30 years ago that wore and wore,the more use the better they appeared.Any questions will try to answer
B00AW8JG9G Great looking boot I really liked this boot, the color, shaft height and overall appearance however I wear a size 11 and for some reason this particular Timberland model &#34;Savin Hill&#34; ran too small so I had to return it.
B00AW8JG9G Gorgeous Boot This boot is beautiful, the materials and workmanship on it are top quality. It fits true to size, and is incredibly comfortable. This is the first tine in years that I haven't had to add insoles to have the &#34;cushioned&#34; comfort I love!
B00AW8JG9G Beautiful riding boots I have been searching for brown riding boots for months and the biggest challenge has been finding a pair narrow enough for my 13-14&#34; calves. These were perfect, and the slightly shorter shaft is ideal for me at 5'2&#34;. The quality of leather is great and the color gorgeous. Feminine and stylish.
B00AW8JG9G Super I haven't had a pair of boots in years and decided I wanted a pair before winter this year.  Years ago, I was a regular boot wearer.  I was very careful and took my time shopping before I bought these.  Well, it paid off.  They are great.  I wear a size 8, bought an 8 and they fit great.  I have a high arch so I loosened the lower buckle and I have skinny legs so I tightened the top to the last notch and they are perfect.  They are not &#34;dress&#34; boots.  But great for everyday wear.  LOVE THEM!
B00AW8JG9G Good boots These are good looking, rugged boots, not &#34;stylish&#34;, but more outdoorsy, walking in woods boots. I wear with socks, and fit is snug but comfortable. Very good boots
B00AW8JG9G My new "go to" footwear I took a chance on these boots after my daughter purchased them (also through Amazon). Put them on and they were a bit tight around the ankles but my wise daughter said &#34;Mom wear them for 30 minutes and then see&#34;. I did just that and sure enough within 20 minutes these boots felt like bedroom slippers. I love these boots and find myself choosing daily wear just to have an excuse to wear them ..all the time. I cannot say enough good things about these boots and am so happy I made the purchase. Side note:They do run true-to-size .
B00AW8JG9G Best Boots Ever!!! These truly are quality and awesome all around boots.  The price is amazing, and if I'd tried these on in person at a Timberland store I would have paid full price.  I'm definitely a &#34;boot girl&#34; and own many pairs in different styles.  I researched the internet tirelessly for a riding boot type, and tried on many pairs in stores.  The leather on these are top quality, the fit is true to size.  I am size 7 in most shoes, so that is what I ordered.  They are perfect with somewhat thin socks, and if they stretch a little as I read in one review then I'll just wear a thicker sock.  And...they look cool and are very comfortable.  I couldn't wait to get them and am wearing them the first day.  I see myself wearing these boots over and over again.  Living in Vermont boot season is just about year round, and these are perfect for many different outfits!  If you order these you will not be disappointed.Extremely Happy!!!
B00AW8JG9G My Friends Hate Me ;) I have this boot in brown and the compliments are flowing.  At first, I couldn't believe Timberland made a boot this feminine and comfortable.  I enjoy the anti-fatigue sole and the lining is very comfortable.  If you can find this boot...get this boot!  It is a &#34;true to size&#34; shoe and the extra room if you need it.
B00AW8JG9G Great knee high leather boots I am 5'5&#34; and these boots hit just below the knee (I wear pants with a 30&#34; inseam).  These are great.  I tend to have bigger calves and ankles, but these fit me very well.  The leather is warm on cool days, but not so warm that I am uncomfortable.  I have not complaints.
B00AW8JG9G comfy They're very comfortable and good for casual dress.  The black is a little too &#34;motorcycle boot&#34; for me, but I still love it.
B00AW8JG9G Great Boots! I just received these boots for Christmas and I love them!  I have thin calves and I have been looking for boots that I don't &#34;swim&#34; in for the past 2 years.  Finally, I found the perfect pair!!  They are comfortable and look great with skinny jeans or dresses and skirts.  Most of all, the price was right especially for Timberland boots!
B00AW8JG9G Lucky to snag these beauties!! I had been coveting this pair of boots in the dark brown forty leather but could not handle paying $240 for them.  They are sold out in the brown almost everywhere and I wear probably one of the most worn sizes in the world (sz 8.5) and couldn't find them anywhere for less than $220 (and even at that I only found one place online that had them).  After eating dinner one night, I just got online and checked an lo and behold they had suddenly come in stock and in my size for $98!!  I ordered them on the spot and just received them. They are gorgeous and seem to be very well made.  The leather seems nice and thick.  They are super comfortable as well.  The only thing worth noting is that they are not truly 'knee high'.  I'm 5'6&#34; and they come about 3 inches below the knee on the taller side and about 4&#34; below on the shorter side.  Love!
B00AZPO90W A nice casual to dress boot Very nice looking.. can be worn in smart casual setting.Very comfortable footbed.One thing I'm not certain of..  I can't find any markings on the shoe or box that indicate this is a &#34;waterproof&#34; boot.  I realize that Amazon's description includes &#34;waterproof&#34;, but note that on Timberland's own site this word is not used.  Haven't tested yet.Sizing:  Fits same as a dress shoe.  Therefore fits about 1 size smaller than you might wear in a running or athletic shoe (eg. Nike).  Ie. I wear a 13 dress shoe (any brand incl. Ecco, Johnston/Murphy, NeilM, etc..) and wear a 14 tennis/running/bball shoe (Nike, Brooks, Vans etc..).  I got the 13 in this and fits very well with normal/dress types of socks.  If you intend to wear thick hiking socks, go up a 1/2 size from this guidance.
B00AZPPEQ0 correct size I read reviews about these shoes and bought a size 10, but it's true size 10. Manufacturer began to improve. I was lucky that I usually wear 10.5 (my foot is 28.6 mm) and not feel discomfort with these boots but so slightly tight. Shoes come with the logo waterproof and it's  &#34;City Lite&#34; and they looks like the picture.
B00AZPPEQ0 Very nice and comfortable boots. I've been a fan of Timberland boots for a while and I currently have four different pairs of Timberland boots. I normally wear a size 11 shoe, but because Timberland boots typically run a little large, I buy 10.5 in this brand. The last pair of Timberland &#34;Earth Keeper&#34; boots that I bought in a 10.5 were still a bit large, so, I bought these &#34;Earth Keeper&#34; boots in a 9.5, and they are a bit too snug. The boots look great for casual wear and they are certainly well made and comfortable. Order one size smaller than your normal shoe size and these should fit well and require no breaking in.
B00AZPPEQ0 Great shoe! So I went to Dillard's and suffered through the painful process of finding a sales person to go into the stockroom only to emerge ten minutes later and say &#34;don't have your size&#34;. So I went home got on Amazon saved money, saved the hassle, and had my shoe two days later just as I ordered. Lesson learned...Excellent shoe. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it and the Amazon price was far below anyone's. (I saved over $30 from Dillard's in-store price and that included the express shipping fee!!! NICE!!!
B00AZPPEQ0 Stylish Waterproof Business Casual Shoe These shoes are waterproof, as advertised! Standing in a few inches of water or trudging through shallow snow is no problem at all.The fit is slightly unusual, so if possible go try on a pair at a local shoe store before purchasing. They seem to be a little long, while also a little narrow.Style is subjective, but these fit in great at my &#34;business casual&#34; office (pants and collared shirts). They are also comfortable, and I have worn them all day with no issues at all.
B00AZPQV6C Best Timberland Boots Overall, these are my favorite boots ever, and here's why:ConstructionThese boots are made of leather, removable soles, canvas laces, and rubber heels. The leather is like suede for the brown boots, and because of the stitching, leather, and rubber, these shoes are waterproof. This suede material is still able to wick away water like if it was plastic (i poured water on them, but I have yet to freeze them). I find the rubber heels to be the best feature of these boots because the point of having rubber soles is to give you grip in cases of rain, sleet, snow, etc. I haven't tested these boots on snow, yet, but so far, they have excellent traction.LookThese boots are not flashy like biker boots, military boots, brogues, oxfords, etc. However, that's the best part of the these boots. Because of my own personal style, I would say that, at best, they can be used for business causal settings during Fall, Winter, or rainy days. However, just because of personal style, a number of factors play into how these boots fit into an aesthetic. However, their beauty is that they're simple which makes them versatile. They don't just fit into the common categories of &#34;casual&#34; or &#34;hiking&#34; or &#34;work&#34; or &#34;dress&#34; boots because it has subtle features of several of those categories, and this is why I like them aesthetically.SizeWhen I read the other comments about these boots, most of them mentioned that these boots were too big by a half size. I disagree. These boots are true to fit, except with a small caveat. They are A TAD BIT loose around the toes. This will obviously feel very different from running shoes, which are supposed to be true to fit. But, let me explain. First, these boots have laces, so you can tie them as tight as you want. I realized that I could tie my boots so that they fit comfortably, AND MY FOOT DOES NOT MOVE IN MY SHOE. In other words, when tied correctly, the boot is snug around my heel and instep, and my toes do not slide to the front of my boot. This means that the boot is fine, but the toes have a little room incase people plan to wear thicker socks, and to allow blood flow to the toes.Also, remember that these are leather. The leather will conform to your foot the more you use them.FeelRight out of the box, these are some of the most comfortable shoes. Usually, shoes require time and use to become more comfortable. However, these shoes were comfortable from the moment I put them on. The sole is soft, although it could use a tad bit more arch support. The toes, like I said above, have a little room, but not too much. The boots are not tight around the ankle. They are especially warm, and like I said above, they are made of leather so I expect them to fit better the more I use them. However, I will say, one should take care of leather precisely because of this fact. If these boots get too wet, they can loose their shape, so just a warning.Last, but not least: THESE BOOTS ARE LIGHT. This should be obvious, but compared to other boots and especially to Timberlands, these boots are not heavy. Compared to canvas sneakers like Chuck Taylors, Vans, etc or any running shoes, these boots are definitely heavier, but canvas sneakers and running shoes are the lightest shoes on the scale. Now, compared to other boots, especially other Timberlands, these feel like running shoes (this is of course relative to heavier and normal boots). That is to say, these boots are on the lighter side on the &#34;boot weight scale.&#34;OverallLike I said above, these boots are excellent. I would recommend them. Don't be concerned with having roomy toes, but if it does, maybe you could try a half size smaller and tell me how that goes.
B00B02THKQ dang it ... my calves are too large I ordered a 8.5, which is my standard size and they fit however I was unable to zipper them up over my calves.  I am not a &#34;heavy&#34; girl but I am a runner and have muscular legs so something to keep in mind when ordering.  Dang it.... they are so cute!
B00B7H57J4 My 2nd pair of Timberlands in 6 months This is not posted as a &#34;CON&#34;.  It is my 2nd pair of different Timberlands in 6 months.  You see I kinda have a thing for Boots, that's all.  I have had these now for at least 2 weeks and I really like them a lot.  Yes there is a little break in involved but not bad at all.  The side zip is a nice benefit.  I bought them purely because of the looks of the boots, and Timberland's reputation.  I have been wearing Timberlands for years.  I really liked the pair I bought in May too.  Those were then, these are now.  Like I said I kinda have a thing for boots.  Having 2 new pair that I like gives me flexibility in what to wear.  Guys, I know how this sounds and Ladies please don't take offense...seems like my &#34;shoe&#34; thing could rival that of some women.  But hey...I kinda get it.  Plus I caught them on sale for a whopping 50% off and free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime.  How could I go wrong?!  I did go with the wide width from reading reviews on Amazon.  I don't necessarily have a wide foot, however, I can't imagine these being too comfortable in the regular width.
B00B7H67E8 Love them.... The insole is really nice, the leather is soft, the shoe is flexible, the sole has good traction.  Yes, they do look &#34;old ladyish&#34; but they can be worn all day.
B00B823WE0 toooooo larrrrgeeeee these are too large... timberland has to correct this &#34;little issue&#34;.. i had to sell my pair of shoes... like an inch and a half bigger than expected
B00B82677E Great Looking Shoe I had to return it.  Ordered the wide &#34;W&#34; but it was too tight across my arch.  Beautiful shoe.  Too bad it wasn't available in a 2W size.
B00B82SDYE good shoe warm, sturdy, good color, good grip on the snow (though I was skeptical because of past timberlands).  worried about the &#34;hooks&#34; on the top of the show breaking off inadvertantly though and don't see a good end if they do.
B00B9PA37A Great price Great boots, get more and more comfortable the more I wear them, they are a &#34;dark tan&#34; but still a great boot at a great price
B00B9PA37A nice looking shoe runs a little large this shoe is not lined with leather and I thought it was a little &#34;stiff&#34;, for a casual type shoe.
B00B9PADZ2 I so wanted to like these... alas it was not to be These are beautiful boots but feel far short of what I needed them to be.I agree with other reviewers who questioned the lifespan of the unlined leather shaft.  Not only did it seem &#34;flimsy&#34; but it made pulling these things on very very hard.  I noticed that the thin laces were put through un-grommeted holes in the leather which makes for a dicey combination.On the color, perfect chocolate lab brown.  Only gripe there is that the leather on my particular pair was a bit &#34;shinny&#34; and flat, unlike the product picture.Honestly I could have lived with all of the above but it was the fit that made me send them back.  Based on other reviewers I ordered the 11 Wide.  My big toe sat in the right spot but everything else was a pain.  The arch in the foot bed was about 2 inches too far toward the toe and while the insole width was nice, there was a narrow pinch along the balls of the foot.I really, really wanted these.  Oh, well, hope yours fit better then mine!
B00B9PADZ2 Timberland Tremont Boots Nice looking boots, pretty comfortable as well. I ended up getting a half a size smaller than i normally wear because of excess room in the toe. Also, the &#34;wide&#34; boot isn't quite as wide as other brands. I would recommend trying them on it a store first or at least be prepared to ship your first set back in order to get a good fit.
B00B9PADZM Great looking waterproof boots My husband bought these boots just before the &#34;polar vortex&#34; and has been happy with them.  They look nice, beautiful leather, and I expect they will hold up for years.
B00B9PIUS4 Great fit and look I have hard to fit feet and these boots are extremely comfortable - can wear with both heavy and &#34;standard&#34; socks - look great with jeans.
B00B9PIUS4 Looks, feels great It's true these shoes run large, order a full size smaller than you normally would. They look great! I've had them for about a month and they're very comfortable for everyday use. Not sure if they would make good &#34;work boots&#34; but they're very comfortable walking around in. I have slightly wide feet but I got them in the regular width, they broke in pretty fast and easy. I'm not used to wearing boots, I find they're a bit of a hassle to put them on/off. So I think in the future I'll look for something with a side-zipper.
B00B9PM56C So far so good... They seem to fit a little snug, but not &#34;small&#34;. This snugness may be do to the extra material inside the shoe. I do get allot of complements on these &#34;looks&#34;, although I bought them as an outdoor boot. My guess is that they might not stay good looking for long, but hey who knows. More importantly they are nice and warm, with decent support. Plenty of tread as well, so the question is going to be whether they hold up over time to hiking and hunting in the woods.
B00BB7BX66 Wow! I did a lot of research before purchasing this pair of boots. Thus far, they have been everything that I could have asked for in a boot. In terms of comfort...they are nearly unbeatable. Even during the &#34;breaking in&#34; period, I did not experience any discomfort. I haven't had any water problems with them yet. Though, I've only worn them during light rain and up to six inches of snow. On no occurrences have my feet gotten wet. Overall, very comfortable and great for light winter usage. I would recommend these to a friend.
B00BCJV7H8 Great Winter Boot These boots are gorgeous. The leather looks very nice and the boots are they are not &#34;clunky&#34;. From looking at other reviews I saw that these boots ran small so I ordered my normal size, 9, in the wide. There is definitely enough space and I the regular width probably would have been fine. I am so excited to have waterproof boots this winter as I have been relying on my Bearpaw boots the past few winters!
B00BCJV7H8 Too Small My wife couldn't force her feet into these boots and she ordered her size.  She would not let me order another pair so she got nothing for Christmas.  &#34;Boot wise&#34;
B00BCJV7H8 Too narrow. These boots are the narrowest &#34;wide&#34; I've ever tried on. They are very cute and appear to be well made. I am disappointed that I had to return them due to the poor fit.
B00BCJV7H8 Love These ! This boots are amazing. The size runs true as I ordered the size I normally wear. I can wear them under or over jeans and they look like a leather boot. Beautiful boots and warm. The &#34;fur&#34; goes clear into the toe area!!
B00BCJV7J6 They wore out in six months. These boots are very comfortable, that's the only reason they got 2 stars. They are not water proof, as the description claims. They soaked through the first time I wore them in the rain. They are definitely not &#34;long lasting wear&#34; as advertised. They barely lasted 6 months and for the price of these boots I would have expected more.
B00BCJW35I Exactly what I've been needing I have a Dolce Vita and a pair of Ash boots from last year that I ADORE, that also have a heel and lug soles, though they are more &#34;designer&#34; and thus when there's any rain or snow they had to stay in the closet&#8230; With these, I get the gorgeous look AND functionality since they're waterproof!! The quality is fabulous, so I'm very excited to add these to my collection. :)I was a little concerned with the fit, as some reviews suggested they were really narrow, but they're pretty good. I'm a 7.5, and definitely *not* narrow, but got an 8 (like my other boots) since I'll obviously be wearing socks, and they fit quite well.
B00BCJXLHW Amazing Winter Boots! These boots are true to size & width&#8211;I have a wider foot than the regular fit, and since I purchased a C/D fit, my boots fit me perfectly! I was a bit skeptical about how &#34;warm&#34; or &#34;waterproof&#34; they were, but after their right of passage with the snow storm that took place, I can say these are serious business!I want to point out two things:I bought the burgundy pair, and they are slightly darker and have more blue than depicted in the images. In my opinion, that doesn't matter since it's still an amazing color (and matched my dyed hair lol).Just to remind you, these boots look slightly chunky, but once you put them on, they look better. At first, these boots feel heavy and somewhat weird to walk in, but you get used to them quite easily.If you are as picky as I am, then let me reassure you: I really love these boots! They are the best winter boots I have bought so far & I am serious about it.
B00BCJXLHW These are beautiful boots, Good soles, delicious color. Finally got my foot into them, only did it once.Way to too difficult to get into and out of. If I were going through security at the airport, I would have missed the plane! They were absolutely marked the right size, though there was an &#34;L&#34;, I'm assuming for &#34;Long&#34;.  I know these are good shoes, I don't know what happened, but they had to be sent back.
B00BCJXLHW These are the real deal If you just want some cute little boots with that fold-over cuff &#34;look&#34;, there are a lot of cheaper options for you.  These are real, weatherproof, built to last boots that also happen to look cute with the tops folded down.  I wear these for trail walking in the mountains where I live where it is slushy in the spring and fall and snowy in the winter and we have rattlesnakes in the summer.I would suggest getting a size larger if you are in doubt between two sizes.  I normally wear either a 9 or a 9.5 but the 10s in this boot fit perfectly.
B00BCJXLHW Perfect I spent a few weeks deciding between buying these or Uggs and I went with these. I figured these are a bit more versatile and I wanted to stand out from the massive amounts of girls in Uggs where I live.  I was a bit disappointed because the item did not arrive by the guaranteed delivery date however I was happy once it finally got here. Super comfortable, warm, and cute! I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 but the only sizes available were 7.5 wide. Got it and it fits just perfectly. Might need to be broken in but I was surprised how snug a &#34;wide&#34; size came. I love it anyway and can't wait to enjoy it for whatever is left of winter
B00BCJXLHW Great show These shoes are comfortable and warm! After reading other reviews I saw that they run a little large so I would recommend ordering half a size down, I ordered mine and they shipped to Ontario Canada very quickly (approximately a week's delivery time) and fit just right. However, I rated these shoes a 4 and not 5 because I ordered dark brown but they are not the colour pictured above and are actually the &#34;tobacco&#34; colour if you look them up on Google images. I did not mind the colour difference, but be warned if you want the dark brown, the picture shown does not match what I received.
B00BCJXLHW Winter boots I bought this specifically for the rainy/cold weather. It fits true to size, BUT if you have wide width feet you might have to squeeze a bit and that's it! First few wears my pinky toes were hurting, I take it that the shoes just needed to be &#34;worn in (?)&#34; It kept my feet very warm (thanks to the lining). Since this was my first pair of boots I personally thought it was a bit heavy which I still need time to adjust. In conclusion I am very satisfied.
B00BF9PSUC Look like slippers and rub the top of my toes raw. The material inside these shoes is hard.  The top of toes ache after only a few minutes of wear.  I've been &#34;breaking&#34; them in slowly for weeks and haven't had much success.  I'm a huge Timberland fan so I never expected to have trouble with these.  Also, I've had several people tell me they look like slippers.  After they pointed it out, they do look like slippers!  When I try them with socks, they really look like slippers and are too snug even though they have too much room in them without socks.  My advise: find another pair that feels better and look like real shoes!
B00C54FI38 Some detail and some praise Sizing detail: On the package, these say &#34;size 9 to 12&#34;. I'm a 9.5 and they fit great.I've only been wearing them a while, but so far they are wonderful. The only sock I've had that could stand in for a business casual, athletic, or comfort sock. The appear to wick away moisture well. They are not as &#34;fluffy soft&#34; as my generic Hanes athletic socks, but are still comfortable on the skin. And I'm someone who tends toward sensitive skin (I won't wear wool sweaters because they are uncomfortable even through shirts...). They are not as thin as the stereotypical dress sock.The only minor quibble I have so far is that the elastic around the top is tight enough to leave minor marks/indentations on my skin after wearing for hours. But I expect that to relax a bit with repeated wearings.(By the way, my wife bought these for me if you are wondering why a &#34;Nicole&#34; is reviewing a men's product).
B00C54FRBG Long lasting socks! My husband loves these socks but they aren't easy to find...&#34;why not look on Amazon!&#34;  duh!  Just as promised but better with Prime!
B00C54FRBG They are socks My son wanted Timberland boots for Christmas (he's 13) so I bought these just &#34;because&#34;-because he needs heavy socks and because they say Timberland on them and 13-year-old's are impressed with brand names.  What else can I say?
B00EAKXW6K Too early to tell. The boots were a lot more $ than I expected, but for a good boot, it will be worth it. I've only worn them for a week and all looks pretty good so far. Length is perfect, but a little too much room inside. I added an additional insole and they are good now. They do come with a 30 day &#34;best fitting boots&#34; guarantee, so we'll see after a couple more weeks.
B00EALU18Q Very Comfortable Shoes I just got these shoes, so I can't speak on durability.  First, I wear a 1/2 size smaller than normal in this shoe.  I normally wear an 81/2 wide, but when I tried on that size, the shoe kept slipping off the back of my foot when I walked.  I was concerned about getting an 8 wide, that it would be too small, but my toes have plenty of room, and, even more importantly, my bunions don't hurt one tiny bit.  They truly feel like they were made for my feet.I tried on the black ones at the store, along with the spattered paint (one on each foot), and walked over to a mirror.  There was another customer there who remarked, &#34;Oh!  I like the colorful ones!&#34;  Her response was so genuine and immediate, that it really helped me to decide.  They don't match with every uniform I have, but they do match nicely with so many.The shoes also feel very well-made.  I expect them to last for years.
B00ED8P6UY incredible buy. Only had them a week but they are miles better then my last boots. Which I also bought thru amazon. Only issue so far is the soles hold on to mud easily. Need to spray them with hose immediately before going into home. But that should improve as they wear down. Great boot. The old adage of, &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34; Applies here. Terrific boot. On  Timberland website boot is $100 more.
B00ENZQ2X2 Pretty much dock shoes I thought these shoes would be pretty skater-like, but in truth they look totally like dock shoes and I feel like a huge tool wearing them.  The first thing my brother said when I wore them around him was, &#34;D*** bro, I didn't know you were a dock shoe d*****.&#34;  Typical but indicative.Also, they are not really soft material and kind of hurt to wear without socks.  I'd look for a pair of Sanuks instead, or at least some other pair that have softer material.  Not happy with these.
B00F53813U Unique hard-to-find color combo! The shoes are great quality. This color combo is hard to find (red & white). They start out a little stiff but soften up as they're worn. The white part is a bit challenging to keep looking &#34;new & bright&#34; but manageable if you just wipe them with a damp cloth after wearing. We have now put them up for the rest of the winter... (too much Chicago snow and salt!) They'll be back out for spring.It wasn't apparent at first (by the description) but these were available only in a size 5-big boys. My son wears a 4.5 boy's and I wear a 7 women's... We can both wear them comfortably... that is, if I can pry them off his feet LOL!Thanks to the seller for a great pair of shoes at a great price and quick shipping! I'll be looking out for other ones that are unique...
B00FJ1TT66 Meh. I go through wallets every 1-2 years and found this one on sale to use as my newest replacement.Functionally it's a great wallet and seems like it will probably hold up for a while.I find the major downside is that the  thin &#34;leather&#34; seems to be coated in plastic that is rubbing/flaking off  in areas that contact each other after a few short months. It looks better in pictures than it does in your hand.
B00FJ1TT66 OK, looks nice but features a bit misleading. I went on the &#34;8 card slots&#34; description and saw the right side (in the product photos) showed 4 card slots.  My assumption was to make 8, there were 4 leather card slots on the other side, hidden from view by the ID holder.Unfortunately, the &#34;other side&#34; which is concealed only has a cheap plastic card holder for the other 4 slots, not leather as is shown on the right side.  The wallet will be functional and usable, but won't last nearly as long as my current one with all leather slots on both sides.  I'll keep looking for that perfect replacement.
B00GIZ8YLS beautiful little coat I initially thought I'd purchase this in black, thinking it was a functional gift for my &#34;adopted&#34; Salvation Army family at Christmastime.  But my daughter convinced me to get it in red, and she was definitely right.  In red, it's not just a coat, but a little boy's favorite red coat!
B00GNZFWA4 LOVE these boots This is my SECOND pair of these.  I bought this pair on Amazon when I got them for an outrageously low price on a daily deal ($50 less than I got my first pair locally!).  I bought my first pair from a local store over a year ago, and they are still holding up, but a little worn and torn. I wear these almost every day for usually 12 hours straight.  They are extremely comfortable.  I have to admit that after a really long day on my feet they do feel somewhat heavy -- but no more so than any other steel-toed, steel-shanked sole pair of foot tanks I've ever worn.  However, they are a solid pair of boots that make for a solid and stable based when walking, climbing ladders, whatever, in any conditions - especially carrying some serious items that I would not want to ever take a misstep or have to question my stability.  A nice tweak I noticed form my earlier pair to these is the lace &#34;holes&#34; on the upper part are well rounded on these, whereas my earlier pair had what appeared to be intended for &#34;speed lacing&#34; but were not too well suited for it and tended to just cause the laces to get caught up.  My favorite thing about them is they easily make me appear at least a couple inches taller!  Based on stability, weight and fact they make you taller -- they remind me of what as kids we'd sometimes refer to as &#34;Herman Munster&#34; - type boots.  They really do feel like tanks you can wear on your feet!PROS:- Protected toe (tested numerous times) - I rest heavy items on them routinely, awesome for avoiding pinched fingers- Protected sole- water repellent (can't say how water proof, haven't remained in a seriously deep puddle with these for long)- comfortable- easy to lace, loosen for ease of putting on and taking off- true &#34;wide&#34; sizing -- I'm a 9.5 if the shoes are wide enough, a 10 if not (but then my feet slide) - these are a true 9.5 wide and fit perfectly.- no odor issues - even after a year!- sole and leather upper hold up well to wear and tear- extra pair of laces!!CONS:- your feet can get a little hot in them during warm months - more breathable than others, but all the comfort materials still tend to lend to them getting a little toasty- can get a little clunky if worn for long periods due to weight (feels almost like wearing diver's boots) - but just think how strong your legs will be!- cloth/fabric (grey areas in picture) get &#34;fuzzy&#34; in appearance as threads break and wear.  No compromise in fit or wear - just makes them start to look quite worn when in fact they are not- as mentioned in their description, flexible in cold weather, however soles become a little &#34;hard&#34; - traction-wiseOverall I love these boots and none of the cons really take away from the quality of these boots.  Having experienced &#34;hikers&#34;, &#34;hunting&#34; boots, the old tried and true brown Timberlands, army combat boots (circa 1980s and more recent), jungle boots, and numerous other brands and styles -- these are by far the best boots I've ever had.  I was planning on going to my local store and getting a new pair when I saw this deal on Amazon.  And should I want or need another pair -- I'd easily put out the extra money to get them again if not on sale.  They are well worth the money - and at a discount even better!
B00GNZFWA4 I love it! It's a very &#34;strong&#34; shoe,maybe heavy than i think.BUT i take it,feel prefect! It make me look very man,ha ha !
B00H46N3TI Can't see them and they feel basically OK These worked as advertised, but the length (as a man) feels a bit short, like you are &#34;feeling&#34; these more than you should. They probably need some Short, Medium and Long versions.
